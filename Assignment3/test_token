ANKARA

Turkey
(

_
Turkey
asked
the
European
Union
on
Monday
to
refrain
from
approving
the
inclusion
of
disputed
Aegean
islets
into
the
union
's
environmental
programs
by
Greece
.

Turkey
and
Greece
,
have
long
running
disputes
over
air
,
sea
and
seabed
mineral
rights
in
the
Aegean
and
both
lay
claims
to
several
uninhabited
rocky
islets
.

``
This
is
a
very
delicate
matter
and
our
call
on
the
EU
is
to
use
its
common
sense
and
not
allow
itself
to
be
used
by
Greece
,
''
Sermet
Atacanli
,
Foreign
Ministry
spokesman
,
told
a
news
conference
.

The
Foreign
Ministry
said
Greece
has
been
including
the
disputed
Aegean
islands
in
EU
environmental
programs
on
waste
,
waste
water
,
natural
habitats
and
wild
birds
.

Atacanli
did
not
name
any
specific
island
.

He
said
there
were
several
islets
,
rocks
in
the
Aegean
Sea
whose
sovereignty
had
not
been
transferred
to
Greece
by
international
treaties
.

The
two
countries
came
close
to
war
in
February
1996
over
claims
to
rocky
islets
,
called
Kardak
(
or
Imia
in
Greek
)
.

Last-minute
mediation
by
the
international
community
deterred
armed
conflict
.

``
This
issue
must
be
resolved
by
talks
together
,
''
Atacanli
said
.

``
Turkey
will
not
accept
any
unilateral
actions
that
Greece
would
take
on
these
geographical
formations
.
''

Atacanli
said
Turkey
has
relayed
its
opposition
over
the
issue
to
the
European
Union
.

BRIDGEPORT
,
Connecticut
(
AP
)

Retired
General
Electric
Co.
Chairman
Jack
Welch
is
seeking
work-related
documents
of
his
estranged
wife
in
his
high-stakes
divorce
case
.

The
Welches
disclosed
their
plans
to
divorce
a
year
ago
,
shortly
after
Suzy
Wetlaufer
_
then
editor
of
the
Harvard
Business
Review
_
revealed
she
had
become
romantically
involved
with
Welch
while
working
on
a
story
about
him
.

In
court
papers
filed
this
week
in
state
Supreme
Court
in
New
York
,
Welch
requested
a
deposition
next
month
of
David
Heleniak
,
a
senior
partner
in
the
law
firm
of
Shearman
&amp;
Sterling
in
New
York
.

He
also
wants
to
subpoena
all
documents
maintained
in
Jane
Beasley
Welch
's
personnel
file
by
Shearman
&amp;
Sterling
,
a
prestigious
corporate
law
firm
where
she
worked
before
she
married
Welch
.

Welch
specifically
is
seeking
performance
evaluations
,
correspondence
between
his
estranged
wife
and
partners
while
she
worked
at
the
law
firm
's
office
in
London
,
and
documents
related
to
her
prospects
of
becoming
a
partner
.

Welch
also
wants
details
on
Jane
Beasley
Welch
's
salary
,
benefits
,
retirement
plan
and
other
compensation
paid
to
her
.

Michael
York
,
one
of
Jack
Welch
's
attorneys
,
called
the
move
routine
.

A
judge
ruled
in
February
that
depositions
in
the
divorce
case
will
remain
confidential
.

Earlier
documents
in
the
case
have
included
embarrassing
details
about
perks
Welch
received
as
part
of
his
retirement
package
from
GE
at
a
time
when
corporate
scandals
were
sparking
outrage
.

The
court
order
was
requested
by
Jack
Welch
's
attorney
,
Daniel
K.
Webb
,
who
said
Welch
would
likely
be
asked
about
his
business
dealings
,
his
health
and
entries
in
his
personal
diary
.

Webb
also
said
details
of
the
breakdowns
of
the
Welches
'
previous
marriages
were
likely
to
come
up
,
and
cited
reports
of
alleged
extramarital
affairs
by
both
.

Welch
has
previously
failed
in
an
attempt
to
temporarily
seal
a
financial
affidavit
.

That
document
detailed
monthly
outlays
of
some
$
51,000
for
upkeep
on
a
half-dozen
houses
scattered
from
Massachusetts
to
Florida
,
more
than
$
52,000
for
gifts
and
nearly
$
9,000
for
food
and
drink
,
among
other
expenses
.

WARREN
,
Mich.
(

)
_
A
detective
and
a
drug
suspect
were
fatally
wounded
during
a
struggle
while
the
officer
was
booking
him
at
police
headquarters
.

Officers
said
investigators
were
reviewing
a
videotape
of
the
lockup
area
in
an
effort
to
figure
out
the
sequence
of
events
that
led
to
the
shooting
Wednesday
evening
.

Detective
Christopher
Wouters
had
arrested
a
suspect
on
drug
charges
,
Warren
police
Chief
James
Vohs
said
.

Both
were
wounded
around
6:30
p.m.
after
the
man
``
produced
a
gun
and
there
was
a
struggle
,
''
he
said
.

Authorities
did
not
immediately
say
whether
the
gun
belonged
to
the
detective
or
the
suspect
.

Wouters
,
42
,
died
an
hour
later
at
St.
John
Macomb
Hospital
.

The
suspect
died
later
the
same
night
,
hospital
spokeswoman
Rebecca
O'Grady
said
Thursday
.

His
name
was
n't
released
.

Vohs
described
Wouters
,
a
19-year
veteran
,
as
a
good
officer
who
was
married
and
had
two
young
daughters
.

It
was
the
first
time
since
1969
that
an
officer
has
been
killed
in
the
line
of
duty
in
Warren
,
a
large
blue-collar
Detroit
suburb
.

ATHENS
,
Greece
(

)

A
retired
navy
officer
facing
life
in
prison
over
a
failed
effort
to
protect
Kurdish
rebel
leader
Abdullah
Ocalan
,
told
a
court
Thursday
he
felt
remorse
for
his
part
in
the
1999
plot
.

``
I
have
a
guilty
conscience
,
''
Andonis
Naxakis
said
during
his
two-hour
testimony
.

Naxakis
is
one
of
13
people
on
trial
for
bringing
the
fugitive
guerrilla
leader
to
Greece
.

Ocalan
was
moved
by
the
government
to
its
embassy
compound
in
Kenya
,
where
he
was
captured
by
Turkish
commandos
.

The
retired
Greek
officer
said
he
had
been
trying
to
get
Ocalan
to
The
Netherlands
,
home
to
a
large
Kurdish
community
.

He
claimed
he
had
been
manipulated
by
the
government
.

``
I
believe
I
was
unwittingly
used
as
bait
for
its
disgraceful
plan
...
an
organized
move
by
the
government
to
hand
Ocalan
over
to
Turkey
,
''
he
said
.

Naxakis
and
two
of
Ocalan
's
Kurdish
associates
are
being
tried
on
criminal
charges
of
endangering
national
security
.

Ocalan
,
being
tried
in
absentia
,
was
indicted
for
entering
the
country
illegally
,
a
misdemeanor
.

Ocalan
,
leader
of
the
Kurdistan
Workers
Party
,
or
PKK
,
is
serving
a
life
sentence
in
Turkey
for
leading
a
15-year
insurgency
against
the
country
that
left
37,000
people
dead
.

He
is
being
tried
in
Greece
in
absentia
.

BAGHDAD
,
Iraq
(
AP
)
_
The
U.N.
official
overseeing
Iraq
's
oil-for-food
plan
said
Sunday
he
wants
to
speed
up
implementation
of
a
new
agreement
that
would
let
Iraq
sell
more
oil
to
buy
humanitarian
supplies
.

``
We
came
to
Iraq
to
discuss
...
how
to
implement
the
enhanced
distribution
plan
and
how
to
speed
the
process
of
approval
,
''
Benon
Sevan
said
as
he
arrived
in
Baghdad
.

``
They
say
give
peace
a
chance
,
so
why
do
n't
we
give
the
distribution
plan
a
chance
,
''
he
added
.

Sevan
,
a
career
U.N.
officer
from
Cyprus
,
said
he
would
meet
Iraq
's
ministers
of
trade
,
health
,
education
``
and
all
those
who
are
concerned
.
''

Iraq
has
been
barred
from
exporting
oil
under
U.N.
sanctions
imposed
after
its
invasion
of
Kuwait
in
1990
.

The
oil-for-food
program
allows
Iraq
to
export
limited
amounts
of
oil
under
a
U.N.
-
monitored
program
to
raise
money
to
import
food
and
other
humanitarian
items
.

The
U.N.
Security
Council
unanimously
agreed
Friday
to
allow
Baghdad
to
spend
dlrs
300
million
of
its
permitted
revenues
to
buy
spare
parts
for
its
oil
industry
to
meet
increased
export
targets
.

Iraq
initially
opposed
this
idea
,
fearing
it
would
make
the
program
a
permanent
agreement
.

But
officials
now
seem
ready
to
discuss
the
enhanced
program
.

The
oil-for-food
plan
permitted
Iraq
to
sell
dlrs
2
billion
worth
of
oil
every
six
months
when
it
first
was
implemented
in
December
1996
.

That
amount
was
raised
to
dlrs
5.2
billion
this
year
.

Hours
before
Sevan
's
arrival
,
a
Baghdad
newspaper
accused
U.N.
Secretary-General
Kofi
Annan
of
doing
nothing
to
fulfill
his
promise
to
get
the
sanctions
lifted
.

Al-Thawra
,
newspaper
of
the
ruling
Baath
Party
,
said
in
a
front
page
editorial
that
Annan
had
promised
to
work
for
the
removal
of
the
embargo
in
a
deal
he
signed
with
Iraqi
leaders
Feb.
23
.

The
February
deal
gave
U.N.
arms
inspectors
_
charged
with
overseeing
the
elimination
of
Iraq
's
weapons
of
mass
destruction
_
unconditional
access
to
all
sites
in
Iraq
,
including
presidential
compounds
.

The
United
States
and
Britain
had
threatened
air
and
missile
strikes
if
Iraq
did
not
allow
the
monitors
into
President
Saddam
Hussein
's
palaces
.

Al-Thawra
's
editorial
reflected
Iraq
's
frustration
over
the
continuation
of
the
U.N.
sanctions
.

It
was
the
first
time
that
Iraq
had
accused
Annan
of
shirking
his
promises
.

CAIRO
,
Egypt
(
AP
)
_
In
his
foreign
policy
debut
as
Syria
's
president
,
Bashar
Assad
met
Sunday
with
Egyptian
President
Hosni
Mubarak
in
talks
on
Mideast
peace
and
the
escalating
violence
in
the
Palestinian
territories
.

Assad
,
on
his
first
trip
abroad
since
becoming
president
in
July
,
also
dealt
with
the
issue
of
Iraq
in
the
talks
with
Mubarak
,
Egyptian
Foreign
Minister
Amr
Mussa
said
.

The
Syrian
leader
's
visit
came
on
a
fourth
day
of
clashes
that
have
raged
in
the
West
Bank
,
Gaza
Strip
and
Jerusalem
,
leaving
more
than
two
dozen
Palestinians
dead
.

``
There
is
complete
agreement
(
between
Mubarak
and
Assad
)
as
to
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
and
that
the
negative
repercussions
would
adversely
effect
the
peace
process
,
which
is
in
itself
in
a
very
precarious
state
,
''
Moussa
said
.

Assad
,
35
,
has
focused
on
domestic
issues
since
his
father
,
Hafez
Assad
,
died
in
June
after
30
years
in
power
.

He
has
taken
steps
to
modernize
his
nation
's
bureaucracy
and
revive
its
stagnant
economy
.

``
This
was
the
first
meeting
of
the
first
visit
of
President
Bashar
Assad
after
the
funeral
of
his
father
,
so
it
was
only
normal
for
the
discussions
to
have
a
general
tone
...
in
addition
to
certain
specifics
of
special
importance
to
both
countries
and
the
Arab
world
,
''
Moussa
said
.

The
late
Syrian
president
rarely
traveled
abroad
.

In
his
last
few
years
,
however
,
he
had
sent
Bashar
,
educated
as
an
eye
doctor
,
on
foreign
trips
as
part
of
his
grooming
to
become
president
.

Prospects
appear
dim
for
progress
on
either
the
Syrian
or
Palestinian
peace
track
.

The
deadlock
in
Palestinian
-
Israeli
talks
is
exacerbated
by
the
worst
violence
in
four
years
.

Syria
's
government-run
media
said
last
week
that
no
progress
could
be
expected
now
because
of
the
U.S.
elections
and
Israeli
Prime
Minister
Ehud
Barak
's
precarious
situation
as
leader
of
a
minority
government
.

Syrian
-
Israeli
peace
negotiations
broke
down
in
January
,
with
Syria
demanding
a
full
withdrawal
from
the
Golan
Heights
,
a
strategic
plateau
captured
by
Israel
in
1967
.

Israel
insists
on
waiting
to
settle
borders
until
it
knows
what
it
will
gain
by
returning
Golan
land
.

Assad
has
made
it
clear
he
intends
to
follow
his
father
's
course
in
any
negotiations
with
Israel
.

Mubarak
and
Assad
met
after
a
week
when
Russia
,
France
,
Jordan
and
Yemen
sent
planes
to
Baghdad
,
challenging
U.N.
sanctions
imposed
on
Iraq
after
its
1990
invasion
of
Kuwait
.

Iraq
is
hoping
other
Arab
countries
will
follow
,
despite
U.S.
complaints
,
easing
its
isolation
.

Moussa
said
the
presidents
discussed
the
situation
in
Iraq
and
would
return
to
it
Monday
.

However
,
he
would
not
comment
on
whether
Syria
and
Egypt
were
planning
to
send
planes
to
Baghdad
.

Egypt
and
Syria
are
on
good
terms
,
but
they
have
had
their
differences
.

Hafez
Assad
's
attempts
to
rally
Arab
leaders
to
present
a
unified
front
against
Israel
gained
little
ground
.

He
derided
Egypt
for
signing
a
peace
treaty
with
Israel
in
1979
.

MOSCOW
,
April
17
(
AFP
)

Silence
is
golden
--
especially
when
your
hand
is
weak
--
top
Moscow
policy
analysts
said
in
an
assessment
of
the
fallout
from
Russia
's
vocal
opposition
to
what
turned
out
to
be
a
swift
US
-
led
campaign
in
Iraq
.

Several
top
diplomacy
experts
told
a
Kremlin-run
forum
that
countries
like
China
and
India
that
said
little
about
the
conflict
before
its
March
20
launch
were
already
reaping
the
benefits
.

Some
suggested
that
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
will
now
be
scrambling
to
contain
the
damage
to
his
once-budding
friendship
with
US
President
George
W.
Bush
because
he
was
poorly
advised
by
his
intelligence
and
defense
aides
.

One
analyst
said
China
--
which
like
Russia
and
France
wields
a
UN
Security
Council
veto
but
never
threatened
to
use
it
to
prevent
the
war
--
recently
won
its
role
as
chief
mediator
between
the
United
States
and
North
Korea
because
other
regional
powers
'
confidence
in
Russia
fell
as
a
result
of
its
Iraqi
diplomacy
.

"
We
are
losing
our
positions
in
Asia
because
...
this
failure
of
a
strategic
triangle
that
(
Foreign
Minister
Igor
)
Ivanov
invented
with
Germany
and
France
,
"
fumed
Andrei
Piontkovsky
of
Moscow
's
Center
of
Strategic
Studies
.

Negotiations
between
Washington
and
Pyongyang
on
their
nuclear
dispute
have
been
set
for
April
23
in
Bejing
and
are
widely
seen
here
as
a
blow
to
Moscow
efforts
to
stamp
authority
on
the
region
by
organizing
such
a
meeting
.

Meanwhile
the
European
"
peace
camp
"
troika
finds
itself
in
tricky
diplomatic
isolation
from
Washington
.

French
President
Jacques
Chirac
received
only
a
reserved
response
when
he
tried
to
mend
fences
by
placing
a
telephone
call
Tuesday
to
Bush
.

Meanwhile
German
Chancellor
Gerhard
Schroeder
has
not
spoken
to
Bush
since
several
weeks
before
the
start
of
the
war
.

But
not
everyone
here
agreed
that
Moscow
's
diplomatic
relations
with
Washington
had
suffered
as
badly
.

Most
agreed
that
Russian
diplomacy
miscalculated
and
urged
Putin
to
quickly
reassess
the
quality
of
his
advisers
.

"
Our
analysis
of
foreign
policy
is
lacking
and
often
reverts
to
Cold
War
stereotypes
,
"
said
former
deputy
foreign
minister
Anatoly
Adamishin
.

"
We
were
so
proud
of
forming
an
antiwar
bloc
with
France
and
Germany
--
but
nations
have
not
been
forming
such
blocs
for
at
least
12
years
and
someone
in
Moscow
should
have
understood
that
it
was
impossible
to
avert
this
war
.
"

"
Our
main
goal
now
is
to
make
sure
that
our
relations
with
the
United
States
do
not
suffer
further
--
and
I
think
this
is
possible
.
"

US
diplomats
have
hinted
in
recent
weeks
that
Washington
's
anger
with
European
resistance
to
the
campaign
was
focused
more
on
Paris
--
and
to
a
lesser
extent
Berlin
--
than
it
was
with
Moscow
.

Putin
last
spoke
to
Bush
on
April
5
at
the
US
president
's
own
initiative
.

They
are
scheduled
to
meet
next
in
the
Russian
leader
's
native
city
of
Saint
Petersburg
in
late
May
.

"
We
lost
nothing
and
won
nothing
--
this
was
not
our
war
,
"
said
liberal
lawmaker
Irina
Khakamada
of
the
Union
of
Rightist
Forces
.

"
We
showed
the
Americans
that
we
would
not
give
up
on
our
position
in
Iraq
cheaply
and
we
did
not
.

We
should
continue
sticking
to
our
principles
.
"

Khakamada
argued
that
the
United
States
would
also
need
Russia
's
help
"
to
make
the
new
Iraqi
government
seem
legitimate
.
"

Most
analysts
linked
Russia
's
opposition
to
a
war
in
Iraq
to
fears
that
it
will
lose
oil
contracts
that
were
sealed
with
the
now-toppled
regime
of
Saddam
Hussein
.

The
floodgates
of
Iraqi
oil
are
also
now
likely
to
open
to
world
markets
and
hurt
Russia
's
budget
revenues
--
which
are
heavily
reliant
on
revenues
from
its
own
energy
exports
.

But
few
at
the
Kremlin
forum
suggested
that
Putin
's
own
standing
among
voters
will
be
hurt
by
Russia
's
apparent
diplomacy
failures
.

Putin
will
face
re-election
in
March
2004
and
analysts
noted
that
the
war
--
while
opposed
by
most
Russians
--
was
never
turned
by
the
Kremlin
into
a
matter
of
national
security
.

"
I
do
not
think
that
this
will
affect
the
elections
unless
Russia
's
failure
in
Iraq
is
presented
as
an
issue
of
national
security
--
and
has
not
been
yet
,
"
said
Viktor
Kuvaldin
of
a
research
center
funded
by
former
Soviet
president
Mikhail
Gorbachev
.

The
International
Press
Institute
(
IPI
)
called
Thursday
for
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
to
open
"
an
immediate
enquiry
"
into
the
murder
Wednesday
of
a
radio
journalist
,
just
"
the
latest
in
a
series
of
attacks
.
"

Serguei
Novikov
,
36
,
was
shot
dead
by
unidentified
gunmen
at
the
entrance
to
his
apartmant
building
in
Smolensk
,
300
kilometers
(
200
miles
)
west
of
Moscow
,
where
he
headed
the
only
independent
radio
in
the
region
.

"
The
IPI
fears
that
Novikov
's
murder
is
only
the
latest
in
a
series
of
attacks
on
journalists
carried
out
as
a
direct
result
of
their
reporting
,
"
said
a
statement
released
at
the
IPI
headquarters
here
.

"
IPI
is
deeply
worried
about
the
apparent
ease
with
which
the
perpetrators
of
such
crimes
have
escaped
justice
,
"
it
said
,
calling
for
"
an
immediate
and
thorough
investigation
.
"

The
statement
also
referred
to
the
killing
of
Russian
journalist
Igor
Domnikov
,
who
was
attacked
with
a
hammer
at
the
entrance
of
his
Moscow
apartment
building
on
May
13
.

Domnikov
,
who
worked
for
the
twice-monthly
Novaya
Gazeta
,
died
earlier
this
month
from
head
injuries
sustained
in
the
assault
.

The
IPI
also
referred
to
examples
of
arbitary
detention
and
bad
treatment
of
media
correspondents
in
Chechnya
,
including
the
arrest
of
Russian
journalist
Andrei
Babitsky
while
covering
the
conflict
in
the
breakaway
republic
.

The
IPI
reminded
Putin
of
his
declared
support
on
July
8
for
the
freedom
of
the
press
.

BELGRADE
,
Yugoslavia
(
AP
)
_
With
Vojislav
Kostunica
in
office
as
president
,
backers
of
the
pro-democracy
leader
embarked
Sunday
on
the
potentially
volatile
task
of
forming
a
government
that
tries
to
exclude
backers
of
former
leader
Slobodan
Milosevic
.

Kostunica
's
team
was
faced
with
a
difficult
task
:
Putting
together
a
government
with
as
few
old
faces
as
possible
,
while
placating
a
Milosevic
wing
that
still
wields
considerable
power
.

``
We
need
a
government
of
discontinuity
,
''
said
opposition
leader
Zoran
Djindjic
,
who
helped
manage
Kostunica
's
rise
to
power
_
from
his
election
campaign
through
the
brief
revolt
that
forced
Milosevic
to
concede
defeat
and
Kostunica
's
swearing-in
Saturday
.

Milosevic
himself
has
said
he
will
remain
in
Yugoslavia
as
a
political
force
.

Kostunica
has
said
he
will
defy
Western
demands
to
surrender
the
outgoing
president
and
others
indicted
by
the
U.N.
war
crimes
tribunal
in
The
Hague
.

And
Serbia
,
the
main
Yugoslav
republic
,
still
is
run
by
a
government
of
Milosevic
cronies
including
Serbian
President
Milan
Milutinovic
_
like
Milosevic
,
indicted
by
the
tribunal
.

Milutinovic
controls
approximately
100,000
policemen
in
his
republic
and
,
indirectly
,
much
of
the
republic
's
economy
.

Kostunica
's
pro-democracy
forces
have
said
they
would
demand
early
elections
for
new
Serbian
parliament
and
president
.

Kostunica
scored
a
stunning
upset
over
Milosevic
in
the
Sept.
24
presidential
election
.

Milosevic
's
attempt
to
deny
Kostunica
's
victory
sparked
a
national
uprising
,
and
he
conceded
defeat
Friday
.

Norway
's
Foreign
Minister
Thorbjoern
Jagland
and
Mladjan
Dinkic
,
the
head
of
an
influential
group
of
economists
,
demanded
Sunday
that
Milosevic
be
punished
for
vote-rigging
.

``
We
now
expect
state
prosecutors
to
bring
charges
against
Slobodan
Milosevic
,
''
Dinkic
said
.

A
human
rights
group
in
Yugoslavia
,
the
Humanitarian
Law
Fund
,
also
demanded
punishment
for
the
ousted
autocrat
,
issuing
long
lists
of
his
alleged
misdeeds
.

Dinkic
also
called
for
a
donor
's
conference
on
Yugoslavia
with
the
aim
of
injecting
at
least
$
500
million
into
the
cash-strapped
country
over
the
next
year
.

Cleaning
house
at
top
levels
is
also
seen
as
important
for
Yugoslavia
in
its
efforts
to
break
out
of
a
decade
of
sanctions
and
international
isolation
meant
to
bring
Milosevic
to
heel
.

Milosevic
is
blamed
by
the
West
for
starting
_
and
then
losing
_
four
Balkan
wars
that
broke
out
in
the
last
decade
when
parts
of
Yugoslavia
began
to
seek
independence
.

Those
conflicts
were
marked
by
horrific
acts
of
violence
against
civilians
,
which
prompted
Western
governments
to
impose
sanctions
and
isolate
the
government
in
Belgrade
.

A
new
government
should
``
be
able
to
show
up
in
Brussels
and
Washington
and
say
:
`
the
country
has
democratized
...
we
ask
from
you
to
lift
the
sanctions
,
''
'
Djindjic
said
.

Both
the
United
States
and
the
European
Union
have
said
they
will
begin
to
lift
sanctions
once
the
new
government
is
in
place
.

French
Foreign
Minister
Hubert
Vedrine
confirmed
Sunday
that
the
EU
would
partially
lift
sanctions
on
Monday
.

Djindjic
spoke
after
the
inaugural
session
of
the
Yugoslav
Parliament
,
where
Kostunica
took
office
.

Kostunica
pledged
to
follow
his
conscience
in
leading
Yugoslavia
and
urged
lawmakers
to
bury
past
enmities
that
led
to
bloodshed
and
chaos
.

The
56-year-old
legal
scholar
promised
to
return
Yugoslavia
to
democracy
and
end
the
ethnic
conflict
and
economic
devastation
that
marked
the
13
years
of
Milosevic
's
rule
.

``
Everything
is
peaceful
,
''
he
said
.

``
Yugoslavia
and
Serbia
have
joined
the
family
of
democratic
nations
.
''

Still
,
discord
could
resurface
,
at
least
in
parliament
.

The
swearing-in
itself
was
repeatedly
delayed
by
Milosevic
allies
who
contested
parts
of
the
Sept.
24
vote
.

And
with
Kostunica
's
18-party
opposition
block
short
of
an
absolute
majority
,
it
appears
compelled
to
deal
with
the
Socialist
People
's
Party
of
Montenegro
,
the
smaller
Yugoslav
republic
.

That
party
backed
Milosevic
until
his
downfall
and
now
seeks
to
have
one
of
its
own
appointed
as
Yugoslavia
's
prime
minister
_
the
constitution
says
that
if
the
president
is
from
Serbia
,
the
prime
minister
must
be
Montenegrin
.

With
the
opposition
outnumbered
in
parliament
,
a
nonpartisan
government
of
experts
,
as
favored
by
many
in
the
Kostunica
camp
,
has
little
chance
of
being
formed
.

WASHINGTON
(
AP
)
_
President-elect
Bush
named
his
nine-member
inaugural
committee
Wednesday
,
stacking
it
with
individuals
who
helped
him
raise
a
record
$
100
million
for
his
presidential
race
.

Fred
Meyer
,
chairman
of
Victory
2000
,
the
joint
effort
between
the
Bush
campaign
and
the
Republican
National
Committee
,
was
named
chairman
of
the
inaugural
committee
.

Four
other
committee
members
raised
at
least
$
100,000
for
Bush
's
campaign
:
Bill
DeWitt
and
Mercer
Reynolds
,
co-chairs
of
the
Ohio-based
investment
firm
of
Reynolds
,
DeWitt
and
Company
;
Brad
Freeman
,
a
California
investor
;
and
Florida
developer
Al
Hoffman
,
who
was
finance
chairman
for
Jeb
Bush
's
gubernatorial
campaign
and
chairman
of
his
inaugural
committee
.

Freeman
,
co-chairman
of
the
RNC
gala
at
the
Republican
National
Convention
in
Philadelphia
that
raised
a
record
$
10.1
million
,
was
named
finance
chairman
of
the
inaugural
committee
.

GOP
national
committeewoman
Julie
Finley
,
another
veteran
fund-raiser
,
was
named
finance
co-chairwoman
.

Jeanne
Johnson
Phillips
of
Texas
,
who
has
raised
money
for
Bush
and
ran
his
1995
gubernatorial
inauguration
,
was
named
executive
director
of
the
inaugural
committee
.

Phillips
was
deputy
chairwoman
of
operations
for
Victory
2000
.

The
committee
members
met
Wednesday
with
representatives
of
the
Joint
Congressional
Committee
on
Inaugural
Ceremonies
to
discuss
plans
for
the
Jan.
20
ceremony
.

Meanwhile
,
representatives
of
several
progressive
organizations
are
making
their
own
plans
for
Jan.
20
:
protests
against
Bush
's
positions
on
such
issues
as
free
trade
,
overhauling
the
campaign
finance
system
,
the
death
penalty
and
the
environment
.

The
groups
hope
to
infiltrate
the
crowd
at
the
inauguration
and
hold
anti
-
Bush
signs
aloft
,
and
plan
a
week-long
series
of
programs
to
highlight
their
objections
to
the
new
administration
.

``
Because
Bush
won
,
there
's
more
of
an
interest
to
protest
,
''
said
protest
coordinator
Adam
Eidinger
,
a
veteran
of
demonstrations
at
both
national
political
conventions
this
summer
.

``
He
needs
to
understand
that
more
than
half
of
the
American
public
feels
that
he
does
not
represent
them
.

SARAJEVO
,
Bosnia
,
Jan.
22
-

U.S.
troops
today
acted
for
the
first
time
to
capture
an
alleged
Bosnian
war
criminal
,
rushing
from
unmarked
vans
parked
in
the
northern
Serb
-
dominated
city
of
Bijeljina
to
seize
a
former
concentration
camp
commander
accused
of
killing
at
least
16
Muslims
and
abusing
or
terrorizing
scores
of
others
.

Goran
Jelisic
,
a
29-year-old
who
described
himself
a
"
Serb
Adolf
"
and
had
made
little
attempt
to
hide
his
presence
in
the
city
,
was
surrounded
without
incident
as
he
left
his
apartment
at
roughly
8
a.m.
He
then
was
transferred
to
Tuzla
,
site
of
the
main
U.S.
military
base
in
Bosnia
,
and
immediately
flown
to
The
Hague
,
where
he
was
placed
in
the
custody
of
officials
from
the
International
War
Crimes
Tribunal
there
.

The
U.S.
military
action
was
planned
in
advance
,
according
to
officials
here
.

But
it
was
carried
out
during
a
week
in
which
human
rights
groups
have
sharply
criticized
the
Clinton
administration
for
refusing
to
let
U.S.
troops
seize
any
of
the
dozens
of
the
indicted
war
crimes
suspects
still
at
large
in
this
country
.

U.S.
forces
provided
backup
support
to
British
troops
that
fatally
shot
one
Serb
and
captured
another
last
July
and
to
Dutch
troops
that
seized
two
Croats
in
December
.

The
U.S.
Embassy
here
issued
a
general
warning
to
Americans
that
they
could
be
at
risk
for
reprisals
.

But
Jelisic
was
probably
one
of
the
least
provocative
targets
Washington
could
pick
.

He
is
not
considered
close
to
the
hard-line
Serb
leadership
and
,
according
to
one
well-informed
diplomat
here
,
"
was
not
popular
"
among
fellow
Serbs
in
Bijeljina
.

A
U.S.
military
officer
said
he
was
"
a
thug
"
without
political
standing
.

Graham
Blewitt
,
deputy
prosecutor
of
the
war
crimes
tribunal
,
nonetheless
hailed
Jelisic
's
arrest
and
said
the
allegations
against
him
"
are
very
serious
.

The
offenses
committed
were
horrific
,
and
the
accused
was
personally
involved
in
a
lot
of
them
.

We
regard
him
as
a
significant
arrest
.
"

Blewitt
added
that
"
we
hope
this
is
not
the
end
of
it
,
"
alluding
to
the
approximately
50
additional
publicly
indicted
war
crimes
suspects
who
have
not
been
turned
over
to
the
tribunal
.

An
unknown
number
of
combatants
have
been
indicted
secretly
by
the
tribunal
,
which
the
United
Nations
established
in
1993
to
seek
justice
for
the
horrendous
human
rights
abuses
that
occurred
during
the
1992-1995
ethnic
war
.

The
two
Bosnian
entities
--
the
Serb
Republic
and
Croat-Muslim
federation
--
are
required
under
the
1995
Dayton
peace
accord
that
imposed
a
cease-fire
here
to
surrender
all
accused
war
criminals
within
their
jurisdictions
.

But
the
top
two
targets
,
hard-line
Serb
leader
Radovan
Karadzic
and
former
Serb
military
chief
Ratko
Mladic
,
are
well-protected
by
armed
guards
.

The
West
's
strategy
has
been
to
try
to
undermine
their
power
.

The
U.S.
military
maintains
an
estimated
8,000
troops
in
the
northeast
"
corridor
"
of
Bosnia
that
includes
Bijeljina
,
a
city
of
fewer
than
100,000
people
that
remains
home
to
many
hard-line
Serbs
.

But
the
city
itself
is
not
patrolled
routinely
by
Americans
and
instead
falls
under
the
responsibility
of
Russian
peacekeeping
forces
operating
under
NATO
command
.

Officials
here
say
that
Moscow
's
policy
bars
any
involvement
by
its
soldiers
in
capturing
war
criminals
,
however
,
and
the
Russians
were
not
informed
in
advance
of
the
American
operation
.

In
a
June
1995
indictment
by
the
tribunal
,
Jelisic
was
charged
with
genocide
,
crimes
against
humanity
,
violations
of
the
laws
or
customs
of
war
,
and
grave
breaches
of
the
Geneva
Conventions
governing
the
treatment
of
prisoners
of
war
.

The
allegations
grew
out
of
reports
that
he
systematically
killed
Muslims
who
had
been
detained
at
a
bus
company
,
a
police
headquarters
in
the
city
of
Brcko
,
and
the
Luka
concentration
camp
.

In
addition
,
according
to
a
U.N.
spokesman
here
,
Jelisic
"
created
an
atmosphere
of
terror
[
at
the
camp
]
by
killing
,
abusing
and
threatening
the
detainees
,
thereby
subjecting
them
to
extreme
psychological
trauma
,
degradation
and
fear
.
"

Some
of
the
evidence
to
be
presented
by
the
tribunal
is
based
on
exhumations
conducted
near
Brcko
last
year
.

Dutch
National
Radio
reported
in
December
that
Jelisic
told
an
interviewer
he
had
no
regrets
for
his
actions
in
Brcko
,
saying
he
slept
well
because
"
I
never
used
knives
to
kill
people
. . . .
That
's
why
God
invented
the
pistol
.
"

When
he
was
captured
today
,
Jelisic
was
carrying
a
pistol
,
according
to
U.S.
officials
in
Washington
.

The
tribunal
's
chief
prosecutor
,
Louise
Arbour
,
has
promised
speedy
trials
for
all
those
detained
.

But
the
tribunal
has
four
trials
underway
and
five
more
awaiting
a
courtroom
,
making
it
unlikely
that
Jelisic
will
be
tried
for
another
year
,
officials
said
.

Arbour
's
predecessor
,
Richard
Goldstone
and
a
group
of
former
U.S.
and
allied
officials
and
jurists
have
criticized
the
Clinton
administration
for
not
ordering
U.S.
troops
to
seize
alleged
war
criminals
.

Goldstone
said
the
U.S.
failure
to
act
had
provoked
contempt
for
the
Dayton
accord
and
impeded
the
creation
of
a
new
Bosnian
nation
.

But
today
,
an
organizer
of
the
group
,
Nina
Bang-Jensen
of
the
Coalition
for
International
Justice
in
Washington
,
praised
the
administration
for
orchestrating
an
"
important
arrest
.
"

CHICAGO
(
AP
)
_
A
federal
judge
has
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
against
Copley
Press
Inc.
blocking
the
sale
of
The
News
Sun
in
Waukegan
to
Hollinger
International
.

The
judge
's
ruling
was
prompted
by
a
lawsuit
filed
last
week
by
the
union
representing
editorial
workers
at
the
paper
,
which
claims
the
sale
would
not
require
Hollinger
to
honor
a
collective-bargaining
agreement
reached
between
the
paper
and
employees
.

Lawyers
for
the
Chicago
Newspaper
Guild
say
language
in
the
agreement
is
``
not
satisfactory
.
''

U.S.
District
Judge
Blanche
Manning
on
Tuesday
barred
the
sale
of
the
paper
for
at
least
10
days
,
giving
Copley
time
to
reword
the
agreement
.

``
If
the
sale
were
allowed
to
proceed
,
the
union
would
be
without
a
legal
remedy
and
would
suffer
the
irreparable
harm
of
having
the
(
agreement
)
being
rendered
a
nullity
,
''
Manning
wrote
.

After
the
hearing
,
lawyers
for
Copley
would
not
say
if
they
would
appeal
Manning
's
restraining
order
.

Calls
to
Douglas
A.
Darch
,
an
attorney
for
Copley
,
were
not
immediately
returned
on
Wednesday
.

The
guild
has
filed
a
grievance
to
have
the
matter
arbitrated
with
Copley
before
the
sale
is
completed
.

Hollinger
International
,
owner
of
the
Chicago
Sun-Times
and
the
Daily
Southtown
in
Tinley
Park
,
is
attempting
to
acquire

newspapers
,
including
The
Courier
News
in
Elgin
,
The
Beacon
News
in
Aurora
and
The
Herald
News
in
Joliet
.

Although
the
ruling
did
not
mention
the
other
Copley
Press
papers
,
it
is
expected
that
The
News
Sun
issue
will
have
be
resolved
before
the
sale
of
the
entire
group
is
finalized

PISCATAWAY
,
N.J.
(
AP
)
_
Terry
Shea
,
who
failed
to
produce
a
winning
season
in
four-plus
years
at
Rutgers
,
will
step
down
as
coach
at
the
end
of
this
season
,
a
source
close
to
the
school
told
The
Associated
Press
Friday
.

Shea
,
who
has
an
11-41
record
,
agreed
to
resign
after
meeting
with
athletic
director
Robert
E.
Mulcahy
on
Thursday
afternoon
,
according
to
the
source
,
who
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
.

The
Star-Ledger
of
Newark
,
Gannett
Newspapers
and
The
Record
of
Hackensack
reported
Friday
that
Shea
agreed
to
resign
.

Mulcahy
and
Shea
signed
off
on
his
resignation
around
7:30
p.m.
,
and
Shea
then
held
a
meeting
with
his
football
team
at
9:30
p.m.
,
the
source
said
.

Rutgers
athletic
director
Robert
E.
Mulcahy
called
a
news
conference
for
Friday
at
noon
EST.

``
That
's
when
it
will
happen
,
''
the
source
said
.

Telephone
calls
to
Mulcahy
and
Rutgers
sports
information
director
John
Wooding
by
The
Associated
Press
were
not
immediately
returned
.

The
Scarlet
Knights
are
3-5
overall
and
0-5
in
the
Big
East
Conference
.

They
have
a
bye
this
weekend
,
then
finish
the
season
with
games
against
West
Virginia
,
Notre
Dame
and
Syracuse
.

After
Rutgers
posted
a
1-10
record
last
season
,
Mulcahy
told
Shea
he
had
to
have
a
winning
record
this
season
and
the
team
had
to
avoid
the
one-sided
losses
that
embarrassed
the
school
in
recent
years
.

After
opening
the
season
with
wins
over
Villanova
,
a
Division
IAA
program
,
and
Buffalo
,
which
recently
announced
its
coach
would
not
be
returning
next
season
,
Rutgers
lost
its
next
five
games
by
a
combined
232-43
margin
.

The
skid
ended
last
week
with
a
victory
over
winless
Navy
.

Shea
replaced
the
fired
Doug
Graber
in
1996
with
hopes
of
building
a
program
with
a
Bill
Walsh
-
type
West
Coast
offense
.

Shea
never
got
the
talent
to
make
it
happen
.

He
posted
records
of
2-9
,
0-11
,
5-6
and
1-10
.

His
five
wins
in
1998
after
going
winless
the
year
before
were
enough
to
earn
him
Big
East
Coach
of
the
Year
.

Rutgers
was
4-29
in
Big
East
play
during
Shea
's
tenure
,
including
1-16
in
league
road
games
.

The
Scarlet
Knights
gave
up
40
or
more
points
in
23
games
under
Shea
.

Shea
has
one
year
remaining
on
his
contract
,
which
has
a
base
salary
of
$
160,000
.

Rutgers
reportedly
had
started
compiling
a
short
list
of
candidates
to
replace
Shea
.

It
includes
head
coaches
Gary
Darnell
of
Western
Michigan
,
Gary
Pinkel
of
Toledo
and
two
coordinators
_
Miami
defensive
coordinator
Greg
Schiano
and
Notre
Dame
offensive
coordinator
Kevin
Rogers
.

ATHENS
,
Ga.
(
AP
)
_
Georgia
fired
football
coach
Jim
Donnan
Monday
after
a
disappointing
7-4
season
that
started
with
the
Bulldogs
ranked
No.
10
and
picked
to
win
the
SEC
East
,
his
players
said
.

``
I
thought
he
would
be
around
another
year
,
''
said
quarterback
Cory
Phillips
,
who
was
at
a
team
meeting
at
which
Donnan
told
the
team
he
had
been
dismisssed
.

``
I
'm
a
little
bit
shocked
.

It
's
an
unsettling
feeling
.
''

Athletic
director
Vince
Dooley
had
given
Donnan
a
vote
of
confidence
just
last
month
.

But
the
players
said
Dooley
told
them
that
school
president
Michael
Adams
made
the
decision
to
fire
Donnan
.

The
athletic
department
scheduled
a
late
afternoon
to
discuss
the
program
but
details
were
not
disclosed
.

Dooley
said
last
month
the
coach
would
not
be
fired
even
though
the
Bulldogs
fell
short
of
preseason
predictions
that
had
them
winning
SEC
's
East
.

Criticism
of
Donnan
increased
a
week
later
,
after
Georgia
Tech
beat
Georgia
for
the
third
straight
year
,
the
Bulldogs
'
longest
losing
streak
in
the
bitter
rivalry
since
the
early
1960s
.

A
win
over
Georgia
Tech
would
have
put
Georgia
in
position
for
a
New
Year
's
Day
bowl
game
,
but
the
loss
left
the
No.
24
Bulldogs
in
the
Oahu
Bowl
against
Virginia
.

Phillips
said
players
asked
Dooley
if
Donnan
could
coach
the
team
in
the
bowl
game
.

If
not
,
Phillips
said
,
players
were
considering
voting
against
accepting
the
bid
.

The
55-year-old
Donnan
,
who
came
to
Georgia
for
the
1996
season
from
Division
I-AA
Marshall
,
has
been
linked
to
coaching
vacancies
the
past
three
years
.

Donnan
has
a
career
record
of
103-40
,
including
39-19
at
Georgia
.

He
has
failed
,
however
,
against
Georgia
's
biggest
rivals
,
going
6-14
against
Georgia
Tech
,
Florida
,
Auburn
and
Tennessee
.

``
Obviously
you
're
expected
at
the
University
of
Georgia
to
beat
the
big
rivals
,
''
Phillips
said
.

``
We
do
have
a
losing
record
against
them
.
''

He
rejected
a
five-year
,
$
4.25-million
offer
from
North
Carolina
in
1997
,
and
was
said
to
be
a
candidate
the
following
season
at
Oklahoma
,
where
he
was
a
former
assistant
.

The
North
Carolina
job
is
open
again
after
Carl
Torbush
was
fired
earlier
this
year
.

Donnan
is
a
native
of
Burlington
,
N.C.
,
and
played
at
North
Carolina
State
.

MOSCOW
(
AP
)
_
U.S.
businessman
Edmond
Pope
,
convicted
of
espionage
in
Russia
,
asked
President
Vladimir
Putin
to
pardon
him
Thursday
,
and
a
presidential
commission
was
set
to
hear
his
request
,
Putin
's
press
service
said
.

Pope
was
convicted
Wednesday
and
sentenced
to
20
years
in
a
maximum-security
prison
by
a
court
widely
criticized
as
being
biased
.

The
president
's
pardon
commission
is
to
consider
Pope
's
appeal
of
the
verdict
on
Friday
morning
,
the
press
service
said
.

Pope
's
lawyer
,
Pavel
Astakhov
,
had
earlier
called
on
Putin
to
release
the
businessman
from
Pennsylvania
,
and
suggested
Washington
push
for
his
freedom
.

Putin
would
have
``
no
choice
''
but
to
pardon
Pope
if
President
Clinton
appealed
for
clemency
,
Astakhov
said
.

``
And
in
this
case
,
the
U.S.
president
has
already
repeatedly
made
such
a
request
.

If
it
's
formulated
as
a
petition
for
clemency
,
then
the
international
practice
,
principles
and
the
laws
of
diplomacy
,
as
you
will
,
leave
no
choice
for
our
political
leaders
,
''
Astakhov
told
The
Associated
Press
.

Pope
's
wife
Cheri
spent
the
day
meeting
with
the
U.S.
ambassador
to
Moscow
,
James
Collins
,
and
other
embassy
officials
.

She
said
that
her
request
to
see
her
husband
had
been
turned
down
,
and
that
she
had
not
had
a
chance
to
discuss
his
next
steps
with
him
.

``
I
do
n't
really
understand
the
Russian
judicial
system
,
''
Cheri
Pope
said
Thursday
.

``
I
still
do
n't
know
what
the
charges
were
.
''

She
said
she
had
requested
an
English
translation
of
the
verdict
and
was
told
that
it
would
take
three
to
six
days
to
prepare
.

Pope
,
a
retired
U.S.
Navy
officer
,
was
convicted
of
illegally
obtaining
classified
blueprints
of
a
high-speed
underwater
torpedo
,
the
Shkval
.

Ever
since
his
April
3
arrest
,
he
has
insisted
on
his
innocence
,
saying
that
the
plans
were
not
secret
because
they
had
already
been
sold
abroad
and
were
published
in
open
sources
.

Pope
and
his
family
maintain
he
should
be
freed
because
of
poor
health
.

He
has
suffered
from
a
rare
form
of
bone
cancer
,
which
was
in
remission
when
he
traveled
to
Russia
this
year
,
but
his
family
fears
it
may
have
returned
.

Cheri
Pope
said
her
husband
also
suffers
from
high
blood
pressure
,
and
he
had
trouble
talking
and
writing
notes
during
an
hour-long
meeting
at
the
prison
earlier
this
week
.

She
said
her
efforts
to
win
her
husband
's
freedom
would
n't
stop
.

``
Every
day
I
try
to
talk
to
someone
that
I
think
can
help
,
''
she
said
.

But
she
has
also
concentrated
on
offering
support
to
other
members
of
the
Pope
family
.

``
Our
family
is
devastated
.

Ed
's
Mom
,
I
ca
n't
talk
to
her
without
her
crying
,
and
we
cry
together
.

It
's
been
very
,
very
difficult
,
''
she
said
.

Pope
is
the
first
U.S.
citizen
to
be
convicted
of
espionage
in
Russia
since
U2
pilot
Francis
Gary
Powers
was
shot
down
in
1960
.

He
was
exchanged
for
a
Soviet
spy
convicted
in
the
United
States
.

Pope
,
54
,
of
State
College
,
Pa.
,
is
the
founder
of
CERF
Technologies
International
,
a
company
specializing
in
studying
foreign
maritime
equipment

Former
housing
secretary
Henry
Cisneros
pleaded
not
guilty
yesterday
to
felony
charges
that
he
lied
to
the
FBI
about
paying
$
250,000
in
hush
money
to
a
former
mistress
.

He
is
charged
with
a
multifaceted
conspiracy
in
which
he
allegedly
worked
frantically
before
,
during
and
after
his
confirmation
as
housing
secretary
to
keep
his
ex-mistress
from
disclosing
their
long
relationship
and
the
extent
of
payments
he
made
to
her
to
keep
their
relationship
quiet
.

The
grand
jury
said
that
Cisneros
also
made
payments
to
a
second
woman
whom
the
ex-mistress
,
Linda
Medlar
,
knew
about
,
and
that
Medlar
was
being
paid
to
keep
that
quiet
as
well
.

Initially
,
it
appeared
that
Cisneros
and
Medlar
,
who
also
is
charged
in
the
case
,
would
not
appear
together
in
the
courtroom
.

At
the
start
of
the
arraignment
,
U.S.
District
Judge
Stanley
Sporkin
announced
that
Medlar
would
not
make
her
appearance
until
later
in
the
day
.

But
just
after
Cisneros
and
two
other
defendants
had
settled
into
their
seats
at
the
defense
table
,
the
courtroom
door
burst
open
.

Attorney
Roger
Adelman
,
a
burly
former
federal
prosecutor
,
stormed
into
the
well
of
the
court
with
Medlar
trailing
behind
him
.

Adelman
launched
rapid-fire
into
the
arraignment
routine
,
leaving
Sporkin
's
clerk
somewhat
speechless
.

He
quickly
waived
formal
reading
of
the
66-page
indictment
and
announced
that
his
client
was
pleading
not
guilty
to
all
charges
.

"
You
are
always
ahead
of
the
game
,
Mr.
Adelman
,
"
Sporkin
said
,
chuckling
.

When
Medlar
joined
the
other
defendants
yesterday
at
the
defense
table
,
Cisneros
looked
directly
at
her
,
and
they
appeared
to
acknowledge
each
other
.

But
she
did
not
hold
his
gaze
and
sat
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
,
leaning
away
from
the
others
.

Their
trial
was
set
for
Nov.
4
.

Cisneros
,
43
,
a
former
mayor
of
San
Antonio
,
headed
the
Department
of
Housing
and
Urban
Development
from
1993
through
1996
and
once
was
considered
a
rising
star
in
national
politics
.

He
was
indicted
last
month
on
charges
of
conspiracy
,
obstruction
of
justice
and
making
false
statements
.

Outside
the
courthouse
,
Cisneros
spoke
out
for
the
first
time
since
he
was
indicted
,
addressing
reporters
in
English
and
Spanish
:
"
I
regret
the
pain
that
this
matter
has
caused
my
wife
,
my
children
,
my
parents
and
my
family
.

They
are
wonderful
,
good
,
loving
people
.

"
I
care
deeply
about
my
community
,
and
I
love
our
country
,
which
I
've
tried
to
serve
in
a
number
of
different
capacities
.

I
came
to
Washington
to
try
to
do
good
,
and
I
'm
proud
of
the
good
we
were
able
to
do
,
"
said
Cisneros
,
accompanied
by
his
attorney
,
Brendan
V.
Sullivan
Jr.
"
I
have
deep
faith
and
trust
in
America
's
institutions
and
particularly
believe
in
the
inherent
fairness
of
our
judicial
system
.
"

Cisneros
now
lives
in
Los
Angeles
,
where
he
is
president
of
Univision
,
a
Spanish-language
television
network
.

Medlar
,
45
,
of
Lubbock
,
Tex.
,
is
also
charged
with
conspiracy
and
making
a
false
statement
.

She
goes
on
trial
Jan.
15
in
Lubbock
in
a
related
case
for
conspiracy
to
commit
bank
fraud
in
connection
with
a
house
purchased
in
the
names
of
her
relatives
with
money
she
allegedly
received
from
Cisneros
.

In
the
Lubbock
case
,
her
attorney
,
a
public
defender
,
has
filed
motions
to
suppress
statements
she
made
to
independent
counsel
David
M.
Barrett
's
assistants
.

Her
Lubbock
lawyer
alleges
that
Medlar
was
having
serious
emotional
problems
,
and
that
prosecutors
knew
it
.

Barrett
's
office
initially
entered
into
a
cooperation
agreement
with
her
in
November
1995
.

But
prosecutors
became
suspicious
of
her
.

In
the
Washington
case
,
she
is
charged
with
lying
to
the
FBI
when
she
said
she
had
given
original
tapes
to
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
of
conversations
with
Cisneros
she
had
secretly
recorded
.

Because
Medlar
says
she
can
not
afford
to
pay
for
an
attorney
,
taxpayers
will
be
paying
legal
fees
for
Adelman
,
who
is
court-appointed
.

The
two
other
defendants
in
the
Washington
case
are
former
Cisneros
aides
Sylvia
Arce-Garcia
,
43
,
of
Los
Angeles
,
and
John
D.
Rosales
,
41
,
of
the
Washington
area
.

Arce-Garcia
is
charged
with
conspiracy
.

Rosales
is
charged
with
conspiracy
and
two
counts
of
making
false
statements
.

JAKARTA
,
Indonesia
,
March
10
(
Tuesday
)
-

Indonesia
's
legislature
appointed
President
Suharto
,
Asia
's
longest
serving
leader
,
to
a
seventh
five-year
term
today
after
granting
him
sweeping
new
powers
in
the
midst
of
the
country
's
worst
economic
and
political
crisis
in
three
decades
.

Suharto
was
elected
by
the
largely
appointed
1,000-member
People
's
Consultative
Assembly
.

The
text
of
the
"
special
powers
"
decree
enacted
by
the
assembly
on
Monday
has
not
been
made
public
,
but
political
analysts
say
it
likely
draws
on
a
similar
measure
,
stemming
from
the
upheavals
of
the
1960s
,
that
was
shelved
a
few
years
ago
.

Indonesia
,
the
world
's
fourth-most-populous
country
,
with
200
million
people
,
is
suffering
its
worst
turmoil
since
that
turbulent
period
,
and
there
have
been
mounting
calls
for
Suharto
to
step
aside
.

"
There
's
no
way
you
can
have
political
reform
while
Suharto
is
still
in
power
,
"
said
one
young
activist
leader
who
has
been
among
thousands
of
university
students
demonstrating
for
political
and
economic
reform
in
several
cities
since
the
assembly
meeting
began
ten
days
ago
.

He
said
protests
will
continue
after
the
assembly
ends
on
Wednesday
,
when
Suharto
is
sworn
in
and
the
vice
president
is
chosen
.

Local
newspapers
reported
that
six
students
were
arrested
on
Sunday
.

Security
forces
have
held
back
from
intervening
,
despite
a
government
ban
on
demonstrations
and
large
gatherings
during
the
election
period
.

In
Washington
,
the
crisis
got
an
extraordinarily
bleak
assessment
from
Michel
Camdessus
,
managing
director
of
the
International
Monetary
Fund
,
who
voiced
fears
that
Indonesia
could
drag
down
neighboring
countries
that
have
begun
recovering
from
their
own
crises
.

"
Even
if
you
have
the
impression
that
we
have
made
important
progress
in
handling
the
Asian
crisis
,
even
if
you
are
under
the
impression
that
Thailand
and
Korea
have
turned
the
corner
,
we
are
not
there
by
far
in
Indonesia
,
"
Camdessus
told
a
luncheon
during
an
IMF
-
sponsored
seminar
.
"

If
this
problem
is
not
solved
soon
,
the
whole
thing
is
at
risk
.
"

Indonesia
's
newly
appointed
armed
forces
chief
has
signaled
he
will
be
tough
on
protesters
after
demonstrations
against
high
prices
turned
into
riots
in
a
number
of
cities
last
month
.

"
If
people
are
hot-tempered
and
ready
to
cut
down
the
symbols
of
the
state
,
yes
,
I
will
gladly
prohibit
them
.

If
they
are
still
determined
,
I
will
be
determined
.

The
difference
is
they
are
breaking
the
law
,
I
am
protecting
the
law
,
"
Reuters
news
agency
quoted
Gen.
Wiranto
as
saying
in
Forum
Keadilan
magazine
.

There
has
been
speculation
that
the
special-powers
decree
would
allow
Suharto
to
take
a
harder
line
against
his
opponents
in
the
name
of
preserving
national
unity
during
the
current
turmoil
.

But
reformers
are
skeptical
.

"
I
do
n't
see
the
need
of
it
because
he
has
special
powers
already
,
"
said
one
Indonesian
political
analyst
,
who
,
like
many
government
opponents
these
days
,
did
not
want
to
be
identified
.

Some
analysts
said
the
decree
could
allow
the
76-year-old
leader
,
who
was
ill
late
last
year
,
to
override
the
constitution
in
naming
a
successor
.

Such
a
move
would
provide
fodder
for
those
who
criticize
the
government
as
feudalistic
.

After
an
outspoken
and
widely
respected
magazine
last
week
ran
a
cover
depicting
Suharto
as
the
King
of
Spades
,
the
government
took
legal
action
against
its
editors
.

The
president
's
children
,
who
have
wide-reaching
and
lucrative
business
interests
in
Indonesia
,
have
increasingly
taken
on
the
role
of
spokesmen
for
the
administration
in
the
political
vacuum
leading
up
to
the
naming
of
a
new
cabinet
.

The
consultative
assembly
,
which
is
largely
appointed
by
Suharto
,
includes
his
relatives
,
friends
and
military
representatives
.

The
political
transition
has
been
cited
by
officials
from
the
IMF
in
explaining
why
they
decided
to
delay
the
latest
payment
of
the
IMF
's
$
43-billion
bailout
of
Indonesia
.

Officials
announced
last
week
that
the
$
3
billion
slated
to
be
paid
on
March
15
will
be
held
up
at
least
until
April
.

The
IMF
and
Suharto
have
been
locked
in
a
standoff
over
the
economic
rescue
package
,
with
the
West
demanding
a
quick
implementation
of
reforms
and
Suharto
dancing
around
the
measures
he
twice
vowed
he
would
carry
out
.

He
also
has
been
dangling
the
idea
of
pegging
the
Indonesian
rupiah
to
the
dollar
--
a
plan
inspired
by
American
economist
Steve
H.
Hanke
that
the
IMF
and
Washington
have
warned
Jakarta
against
.

Both
IMF
and
Indonesian
officials
sought
today
to
play
down
their
sparring
--
which
has
roiled
Southeast
Asian
markets
--
following
comments
Suharto
was
quoted
as
making
over
the
weekend
that
led
some
analysts
to
fear
the
president
had
dug
in
his
nationalist
heels
and
decided
to
reject
the
bailout
altogether
.

Jusuf
Syakir
,
chairman
of
the
Muslim
-
dominated
United
Development
Party
,
emerged
from
a
meeting
with
Suharto
on
Sunday
announcing
that
the
president
said
the
IMF
reforms
were
"
not
in
line
"
with
the
constitution
.

Specifically
,
Syakir
quoted
Suharto
as
saying
,
the
reforms
went
against
an
article
stipulating
that
the
economy
should
be
organized
"
based
upon
the
principle
of
the
family
system
.
"

Few
Indonesians
,
foreign
businessmen
or
diplomats
missed
the
irony
in
a
statement
coming
from
a
president
whose
family
has
amassed
more
than
$
16
billion
over
the
past
three
decades
and
helped
inspire
the
term
"
crony
capitalism
.
"

Today
Bambang
Trihatmodjo
,
one
of
Suharto
's
tycoon
children
and
a
senior
assembly
member
,
said
the
IMF
agreement
might
have
to
be
renegotiated
,
the
Associated
Press
reported
.

MADISON
,
Wisconsin
,
June
16
(
AFP
)

The
skeleton
of
a
second
baby
has
been
found
at
a
rural
Wisconsin
home
where
a
22-year-old
woman
's
dead
infant
was
discovered
in
a
blue
plastic
container
June
8
,
officials
said
Monday
.

Kristin
Scott
,
the
mother
,
told
police
she
gave
birth
secretly
to
both
babies
at
her
parents
'
home
in
Byrds
Creek
,
Richland
County
,
one
of
unknown
sex
in
April
2001
and
the
other
,
a
fullterm
girl
,
January
14
.

Police
arrested
her
in
Abilene
,
Texas
,
Saturday
where
she
had
moved
with
a
friend
June
2
.

She
is
being
held
on
50,000
dollars
bail
on
a
charge
of
first-degree
reckless
homicide
and
hiding
a
corpse
in
the
death
of
the
infant
born
in
January
.

Scott
told
police
she
did
not
tend
to
the
baby
,
and
it
died
after
30
minutes
.

She
said
the
baby
had
to
die
,
according
to
the
criminal
complaint
.

The
woman
's
parents
,
William
and
Nancy
Scott
,
found
the
decomposing
body
of
the
first
baby
in
her
closet
after
they
went
looking
for
the
source
of
a
foul
odor
in
their
house
.

Scott
told
investigators
she
had
moved
that
body
around
before
she
moved
to
Texas
,
sometimes
in
the
closet
at
the
Byrds
Creek
house
,
in
the
trunk
of
her
car
and
in
the
closet
of
her
apartment
in
Richland
Center
,
the
complaint
said
.

The
sheriff
released
no
other
details
about
the
second
baby
.

UNITED
NATIONS
(
AP
)
_
Alarmed
over
new
violence
in
Sierra
Leone
,
the
Security
Council
appealed
Friday
to
the
Nigerian
-
led
African
intervention
force
to
allow
speedy
delivery
of
humanitarian
aid
now
that
that
its
troops
have
captured
the
West
African
nation
's
capital
.

The
Nigerian
-
led
force
launched
an
attack
last
week
to
unseat
the
military
junta
and
restore
the
country
's
elected
president
,
Ahmed
Tejan
Kabbah
,
who
was
ousted
last
May
in
a
bloody
coup
.

Nigerian
-
led
troops
captured
large
parts
of
the
center
of
the
capital
,
Freetown
,
on
Thursday
.

Civilians
reportedly
celebrated
in
the
streets
.

The
events
in
Sierra
Leone
were
deeply
embarrassing
to
the
council
,
however
.

Although
the
15
members
had
called
for
Kabbah
's
restoration
,
they
had
never
authorized
the
use
of
force
.

Instead
,
the
council
had
endorsed
an
agreement
reached
last
year
for
a
peaceful
restoration
of
the
elected
government
by
April
22
.

Foreign
ministers
of
the
West
African
countries
involved
in
the
peacekeeping
force
had
visited
U.N.
headquarters
last
week
but
gave
no
indication
they
were
about
to
launch
a
bid
to
overthrow
the
junta
.

``
The
Security
Council
expressed
its
concern
over
the
very
unstable
situation
in
parts
of
the
country
and
over
the
heavy
civilian
losses
which
have
been
reported
,
''
council
President
Denis
Dangue
Rewaka
of
Gabon
told
reporters
after
a
meeting
.

``
The
Security
Council
has
emphasized
that
international
humanitarian
law
must
be
upheld
,
''
he
added
.

``
The
Security
Council
called
for
the
humanitarian
assistance
to
be
activated
immediately
,
including
cross-border
operations
,
and
for
full
,
unrestricted
access
to
the
people
in
need
.
''

Dangue
Rewaka
also
said
the
council
urged
protection
of
international
aid
workers
and
steps
to
return
the
country
to
stability
.

It
urged
the
Nigerian
-
led
force
``
to
cooperate
fully
''
with
the
United
Nations
``
with
the
view
of
rapid
evaluation
of
the
situation
on
the
ground
.
''

Dangue
Rewaka
refused
to
say
whether
the
council
felt
embarrassed
by
the
failure
of
West
African
foreign
ministers
to
notify
them
in
advance
of
the
campaign
.

But
he
noted
that
the
council
had
never
authorized
the
West
Africans
to
use
force
to
oust
the
junta
.

He
acknowledged
that
the
council
was
``
concerned
by
the
use
of
force
.
''

During
the
meeting
,
the
U.N.
humanitarian
coordinator
,
Sergio
de
Mello
,
said
about
250,000
people
had
been
displaced
by
the
fighting
.

De
Mello
said
the
situation
was
``
dramatic
,
not
only
in
the
area
of
Freetown
''
but
elsewhere
in
the
country
.

The
West
African
force
intervened
in
Sierra
Leone
soon
after
the
junta
led
by
Maj.
Johnny
Koroma
toppled
Kabbah
.

After
bombarding
Freetown
in
a
failed
attempt
to
drive
the
junta
from
power
,
the
force
blockaded
Freetown
's
port
to
prevent
food
,
fuel
and
other
necessities
from
reaching
the
city
.

Despite
international
criticism
of
its
human-rights
record
,
Nigeria
_
apparently
trying
to
improve
its
image
and
its
clout
in
the
region
_
has
become
a
self-appointed
protector
of
democracy
in
parts
of
Africa
.

NEW
YORK
_
A
Brooklyn
woman
who
was
watching
her
clothes
dry
in
a
laundromat
was
killed
Thursday
evening
when
two
would-be
robbers
emptied
their
pistols
into
the
store
,
the
police
said
.

The
men
appeared
in
the
store
at
469
Vermont
St.
in
Brownsville
around
7:15
p.m.
,
after
the
victim
,
Linda
Sanders
,
35
,
had
finished
her
cleaning
and
was
waiting
for
her
clothes
to
dry
,
detectives
said
.

``
It
looks
as
though
they
panicked
,
''
a
detective
,
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
,
said
of
the
robbers
.

``
They
intended
to
rob
the
place
.

There
were
four
or
five
people
inside
,
and
they
just
started
firing
.
''

Ms.
Sanders
was
hit
several
times
and
was
pronounced
dead
at
the
scene
.

The
other
customers
fled
,
and
the
police
said
it
did
not
appear
that
anyone
else
was
injured
.

The
men
took
no
money
from
their
victim
or
from
the
establishment
,
said
Detective
Joseph
Pentangelo
,
a
Police
Department
spokesman

Victor
Miranda
,
who
lives
in
Ms.
Sanders
'
apartment
building
at
405
Williams
Ave.
,
said
the
laundry
machines
in
the
building
were
removed
a
few
years
ago
to
make
room
for
management
offices
.

Russian
police
announced
Thursday
that
they
had
caught
the
killer
of
Valentin
Smirnov
,
the
head
of
a
major
weapons
design
bureau
in
the
Urals
city
of
Yekaterinburg
who
was
shot
dead
on
March
20
.

The
murder
was
a
revenge
killing
triggered
by
a
dispute
over
the
sale
of
precious
metals
,
investigators
said
.

Smirnov
,
inventor
of
the
advanced
S-300
anti-aircraft
missile
system
,
was
murdered
near
his
home
in
the
city
.

Regional
investigators
quoted
by
ITAR-TASS
news
agency
said
six
people
had
been
arrested
in
connection
with
Smirnov
's
death
--
a
contract
killer
,
the
man
who
ordered
the
murder
and
four
intermediaries
.

Vladislav
Tuykov
,
the
Sverdlovsk
regional
prosecutor
,
said
the
killing
was
ordered
by
Smirnov
's
colleague
Yuri
Pinzhenin
,
44
.

Since
1993
,
Pinzhenin
had
headed
an
enterprise
affiliated
to
the
design
bureau
which
extracted
precious
metals
from
weapons
and
sold
them
.

Smirnov
was
a
co-founder
of
the
enterprise
and
signed
all
the
relevant
financial
documents
.

Tuykov
said
Pinzhenin
had
forged
some
documents
concerning
sales
of
precious
metals
and
Smirnov
had
failed
to
persuade
him
to
return
money
he
had
stolen
from
the
enterprise
.

Smirnov
took
the
matter
to
the
authorities
and
Pinzhenin
decided
to
kill
him
.

Tuykov
said
the
intermediaries
had
hired
the
29-year-old
killer
,
an
unemployed
member
of
a
criminal
gang
,
for
22,500
dollars
,
of
which
the
killer
received
only
3,000
.

The
killer
showed
investigators
a
drain
where
he
had
hidden
the
pistol
used
in
the
murder
,
Tuykov
said
,
adding
that
the
six
held
by
police
would
be
officially
charged
with
the
killing
Monday
.

The
six
had
confessed
to
taking
part
in
the
murder
and
police
had
collected
documents
incriminating
them
,
the
prosecutor
added
.

JERUSALEM
(
AP
)
_
Israel
will
ask
the
United
States
to
delay
a
military
strike
against
Iraq
until
the
Jewish
state
is
fully
prepared
for
a
possible
Iraqi
attack
with
non-conventional
weapons
,
the
defense
minister
said
in
remarks
published
Friday
.

Also
Friday
,
the
United
States
announced
that
it
sent
a
team
from
the
Center
for
Disease
Control
to
assist
the
Palestinian
Authority
in
assessing
its
ability
to
protect
its
population
in
the
event
of
a
biological
or
chemical
weapon
attack
by
Iraq
.

The
U.S.
ambassador
to
Israel
,
Edward
Walker
,
assured
Defense
Minister
Yitzhak
Mordechai
in
a
meeting
that
Israel
would
have
enough
time
to
properly
prepare
.

Israel
is
equipping
its
residents
with
gas
masks
and
preparing
kits
with
antidotes
.

Gabi
Ofir
,
the
commander
of
Israel
's
distribution
centers
told
Israel
Radio
that
300,000
gas
mask
kits
have
been
dispensed
to
the
public
in
the
last
several
weeks
.

Israel
has
been
scrambling
to
buy
more
masks
abroad
.

after
a
shortage
of
several
hundred
thousand
gas
masks
,
including
those
for
young
children
,
was
discovered
.

Germany
has
agreed
to
lend
Israel
180,000
protective
kits
against
chemical
and
biological
weapons
,
and
Switzerland
offered
to
lend
Israel
another
25,000
masks
.

In
Stockholm
,
the
Swedish
government
announced
it
has
authorized
the
sale
of
up
to
80,000
gas
masks
for
children
.

Government
spokesman
Moshe
Fogel
said
Israel
appreciated
the
Swiss
offer
,
but
would
have
to
determine
the
masks
'
compatibility
to
Israel
's
needs
before
accepting
.

Meanwhile
,
an
Israeli
delegation
traveled
Friday
to
Oslo
to
examine
200,000
gas
masks
the
Norwegian
government
has
offered
,
Israel
radio
said
.

Prime
Minister
Benjamin
Netanyahu
called
the
prime
minister
of
the
Netherlands
to
thank
him
for
thousands
of
gas
masks
his
country
has
already
contributed
.

The
Defense
Ministry
said
16
planes
have
landed
so
far
with
protective
equipment
against
biological
and
chemical
warfare
.

Mordechai
said
all
the
gas
masks
from
abroad
would
arrive
soon
and
be
distributed
to
the
public
,
adding
that
additional
distribution
centers
would
be
set
up
next
week
.

``
There
is
no
reason
why
we
would
not
be
prepared
,
''
Mordechai
told
the
Yediot
Ahronot
daily
.

``
If
,
in
spite
of
everything
,
we
will
not
be
ready
,
we
will
ask
the
United
States
to
delay
the
operation
.
''

``
There
is
no
certainty
that
they
will
do
what
we
ask
,
but
they
will
definitely
take
into
consideration
our
readiness
,
''
he
added
.

Israel
's
armed
forces
chief
,
Lt.
Gen.
Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak
,
appeared
on
national
television
Friday
night
in
attempt
to
reassure
a
jittery
public
.

``
When
events
are
concrete
and
actually
unfolding
,
we
will
include
the
entire
population
in
the
measures
we
decide
are
appropriate
to
take
,
''
Shahak
said
in
an
interview
with
Channel
Two
Television
.

Iraqi
Deputy
Prime
Minister
Tariq
Aziz
said
earlier
this
week
that
Baghdad
has
no
intention
of
attacking
Israel
even
if
Iraq
is
targeted
by
the
United
States
.

But
Netanyahu
said
Thursday
that
he
would
not
rely
on
Iraqi
promises
when
it
came
to
Israel
's
security
.

The
United
States
has
promised
to
defend
Israel
,
and
the
daily
Maariv
said
Friday
that
the
Americans
had
agreed
to
send
Israel
special
equipment
for
detecting
chemical
or
biological
weapons
.

Israeli
troops
will
go
to
the
United
States
next
week
to
train
with
the
equipment
,
Maariv
added
.

Several
pro
-
Iraq
demonstrations
have
taken
place
in
the
last
week
in
the
Gaza
Strip
and
the
West
Bank
despite
the
Palestinian
Authority
's
public
opposition
to
them
.

A
spokesman
for
the
Arab
Liberation
Front
,
a
Palestinian
group
that
has
been
organizing
pro
-
Iraq
demonstrations
,
claimed
their
leader
was
arrested
Friday
by
the
Palestinian
police
in
the
Gaza
Strip
.

MOSCOW
(
AP
)
_
American
businessman
Edmond
Pope
got
a
brief
break
from
his
Moscow
espionage
trial
Thursday
when
the
judge
cut
short
hearings
so
that
he
could
observe
Thanksgiving
.

Pope
,
accused
of
seeking
classified
plans
for
a
high-speed
torpedo
,
spent
the
morning
in
the
suspects
'
cage
in
a
Moscow
courtroom
,
as
he
has
throughout
the
monthlong
,
closed-door
trial
.

``
He
was
n't
in
a
holiday
mood
,
''
defense
attorney
Pavel
Astakhov
said
.

After
he
returned
to
Lefortovo
prison
in
the
afternoon
,
a
U.S.
consular
officer
was
to
bring
him
some
turkey
,
Astakhov
said
.

But
the
officer
was
refused
access
to
Pope
,
a
U.S.
Embassy
official
said
.

Consular
officials
have
been
allowed
to
meet
with
Pope
only
on
a
few
occasions
since
his
April
arrest
.

The
defense
marked
a
small
victory
Thursday
morning
when
Judge
Nina
Barkina
threw
out
one
volume
of
documents
of
the
eight-volume
indictment
.

Astakhov
said
the
documents
were
related
to
witnesses
who
have
not
been
called
to
testify
in
court
.

Barkina
has
turned
down
most
of
the
defense
's
motions
,
and
a
defense
effort
to
have
her
removed
from
the
case
Wednesday
was
rejected
.

Among
the
witnesses
whose
testimony
was
thrown
out
was
U.S.
researcher
Daniel
H.
Kiely
,
who
was
arrested
along
with
Pope
.

Kiely
,
head
of
energy
and
power
systems
at
Pennsylvania
State
University
's
Applied
Research
Laboratory
,
was
released
after
being
questioned
by
Russian
authorities
and
says
he
knows
nothing
about
the
alleged
purchase
of
secret
data
.

Pope
's
supporters
say
the
plans
he
was
seeking
were
already
sold
abroad
and
were
n't
classified
.

One
of
Pope
's
key
accusers
has
recanted
a
statement
that
implicated
him
in
espionage
.

But
a
government
commission
concluded
that
the
plans
,
parts
of
which
Pope
received
before
his
arrest
,
were
in
fact
classified
.

Pope
,
54
,
of
State
College
,
Pa.
,
is
a
retired
U.S.
Navy
officer
and
founder
of
CERF
Technologies
International
,
a
company
specializing
in
studying
foreign
maritime
equipment
.

The
U.S.
government
has
urged
Russia
to
release
Pope
,
saying
Russian
authorities
have
failed
to
show
he
did
anything
illegal
,
and
because
of
his
health
.

His
family
fears
that
Pope
's
bone
cancer
,
which
was
in
remission
when
he
came
to
Moscow
,
may
have
returned
.

Bank
of
America

For
the
three
months
ended
Sept.
30
,
Bank
of
America
earned
$
1.83
billion
,
or
$
1.10
per
share
.

In
the
year-ago
period
,
the
Charlotte
,
N.C.
-
based
bank
earned
$
2.2
billion
,
or
$
1.23
a
share
.

Bank
officials
pointed
to
higher
interest
rates
as
well
as
a
$
346
million
restructuring
charge
and
a
$
257
million
drop
in
the
value
of
auto
leases
.

``
Bank
of
America
in
the
third
quarter
faced
the
same
headwind
of
higher
interest
rates
and
a
slowing
economy
as
other
banks
,
''
said
Hugh
L.
McColl
Jr.
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
.

In
July
,
Bank
of
America
said
it
planned
to
cut
as
many
as
10,000
jobs
as
it
changes
its
focus
from
growing
through
mergers
to
becoming
more
profitable
through
use
of
technology
and
operating
efficiency
.

Excluding
the
charges
,
the
bank
had
operating
profits
of
$
2.18
billion
,
or
$
1.31
a
share
,
in
this
year
's
third
quarter
.

Analysts
surveyed
by
First
Call/Thomson
Financial
were
expecting
$
1.29
per
share
.

Shares
of
Bank
of
America
fell
$
1.44
to
$
45.13
in
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

The
entire
banking
industry
has
faced
a
climate
of
higher
interest
rates
over
the
past
year
.

The
higher
rates
have
made
the
cost
banks
pay
for
their
money
increase
faster
than
banks
have
been
able
to
increase
their
prices
for
loans
or
other
assets
,
analysts
say
.

For
the
nine
months
ended
Sept.
30
,
net
income
was
$
6.13
billion
,
or
$
3.66
per
share
,
up
from
$
5.98
billion
,
or
$
3.37
per
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

With
$
671
billion
in
assets
as
of
Sept.
30
,
Bank
of
America
is
the
nation
's
second-largest
bank
in
terms
of
assets
behind
Citigroup
.

It
has
branches
in
21
states
and
the
District
of

.

Bank

Bank
of

said
its
net

totaled
$
363
million
,
or
49

a

,
in
the
third

compared
with
$

,
or
$
1.02

a

.

The
third-quarter
performance
was
in
line
with
estimates
from
analysts
surveyed
by

.

After
adjustment
for
one-time
items
,
including
a

from
the

net
income
in
the
third

totaled
$
313

,
the
New

said
.

``
This

continues
to
reflect
the
fundamental
strength
of
our
long-term
strategy
,
''
chairman
and
chief

Thomas
A.
Renyi
said
in
a
statement
accompanying
the
earnings
.

For
the
nine

ended
Sept.

,
the

reported
net

of
$
1.06

compared
with

,
injured
11
people
and
sent
showers
of
shattered
glass
and
debris
down
on
to
the
busy
Tverskaya
street
.

The
Federal
Security
Service
(
FSB
)
said
a
two
kilogramme
(
4.4
pound
)
charge
had
ripped
a
large
hole
in
the
back
of
the
hotel
,
but
declined
to
say
whether
remains
of
the
explosive
had
been
discovered
.

"
It
can
not
be
ruled
out
that
the
bomb
...
had
a
precise
'
target
'
:
for
example
,
one
of
the
directors
of
the
various
commercial
organisations
which
rent
almost
half
of
the
hotel
,
"
the
liberal
Sevodnya
daily
said
.

The
influential
Kommersant
business
daily
,
citing
police
sources
,
said
"
the
incident
could
have
been
a
warning
to
Iosef
Kobzon
,
who
is
involved
in
oil
refining
,
sale
of
foodstuffs
and
metals
,
as
well
as
show
business
.
"

The
singer
,
dubbed
the
"
Russian
Frank
Sinatra
,
"
is
reputedly
close
to
Moscow
mayor
Yury
Luzhkov
.

A
high-profile
defender
of
Jewish
causes
,
Kobzon
was
scheduled
to
hold
a
meeting
in
the
hotel
at
the
time
of
the
blast
but
had
been
delayed
.

Speaking
shortly
after
the
blast
Kobzon
dismissed
suggestions
that
he
could
have
been
the
bombers
'
target
.

Kommersant
added
that
another
businessman
,
Anzor
Arteniyev
,
could
have
been
the
intended
victim
.

He
had
been
the
partner
of
Otari
Kvantrishvili
,
who
was
gunned
down
in
1994
.

In
the
wake
of
the
blast
police
said
Monday
they
were
hunting
four
men
of
Caucasian
origin
spotted
in
a
car
near
the
hotel
shortly
after
the
explosion
.

"
Unspecified
Caucasians
have
been
mentioned
in
this
affair
,
which
means
that
the
investigators
either
have
no
real
line
of
inquiry
or
that
it
is
so
important
that
they
will
do
all
that
they
can
to
stifle
"
the
real
reasons
behind
the
attack
.

The
second
hypothesis
"
seems
far
more
likely
to
be
truth
,

Snyder
Communications
Inc.
of
Bethesda
announced
yesterday
that
it
has
acquired
Arnold
Communications
Inc.
,
one
of
New
England
's
biggest
advertising
agencies
,
significantly
expanding
the
marketing
services
it
can
offer
to
clients
.

The
purchase
price
was
not
disclosed
,
but
analysts
estimated
it
was
about
$
120
million
in
stock
.

They
said
Snyder
gains
a
nationally
known
creative
powerhouse
by
buying
Boston
-
based
Arnold
.

Snyder
creates
targeted
marketing
campaigns
for
telecommunications
,
packaged
goods
and
pharmaceutical
companies
.

Privately
held
Arnold
,
which
had
about
$
750
million
in
billings
and
$
90.7
million
in
revenue
last
year
,
handles
advertising
for
such
major
corporations
as
McDonald
's
Corp.
,
Volkswagen
of
America
Inc.
and
Bell
Atlantic
Corp.
Its
local
office
in
McLean
is
one
of
the
biggest
ad
agencies
in
the
Washington
area
,
with
such
clients
as
the
National
Geographic
Society
,
the
American
Red
Cross
and
SAP
AG
,
the
German
software
maker
.

Adweek
,
a
trade
publication
,
recently
selected
Arnold
as
the
New
England
Agency
of
the
Year
for
the
third
straight
year
.

An
increasing
number
of
Fortune
500
companies
are
turning
to
a
single
agency
to
handle
all
of
their
marketing
and
communications
needs
.

Previously
,
corporations
would
spread
their
work
around
--
for
example
,
one
firm
would
handle
public
relations
and
another
would
do
advertising
--
but
nowadays
they
look
for
a
single
"
fully
integrated
"
agency
.

For
this
reason
,
analysts
said
,
the
Arnold
acquisition
is
a
smart
move
for
Snyder
,
.

With
900
employees
,
Arnold
operates
in
several
business
areas
that
Snyder
does
not
,
including
advertising
,
public
relations
and
interactive
media
services
.

Arnold
's
direct
marketing
and
database
management
services
will
complement
current
offerings
by
Snyder
,
analysts
said
.

"
This
brings
some
new
clients
to
Synder
and
presents
some
opportunities
for
cross-selling
,
"
said
Fran
Blechman
Bernstein
,
an
analyst
at
Merrill
Lynch
Global
Securities
.

Daniel
M.
Snyder
,
Snyder
's
33-year-old
chairman
and
chief
executive
,
who
founded
the
company
with
his
sister
in
1987
,
said
the
purchase
will
particularly
help
the
firm
expand
its
direct-to-consumer
pharmaceutical
marketing
business
.

In
the
past
few
years
,
drug
companies
have
started
targeting
their
products
to
specific
patient
groups
,
in
addition
to
selling
to
health-care
officials
.

Snyder
has
marketed
to
patients
since
its
founding
.

For
example
,
the
company
produces
"
WallBoards
,
"
posters
with
graphics
,
information
and
advertising
in
doctors
'
offices
and
other
medical
facilities
.

With
the
acquisition
of
Arnold
,
Snyder
can
make
television
commercials
for
its
pharmaceutical
clients
,
which
include
16
of
the
top
20
drug
companies
.

"
Arnold
is
a
perfect
,
perfect
fit
for
our
health-care
areas
,
"
Daniel
Snyder
said
.

Snyder
said
Arnold
will
still
be
based
in
Boston
and
operate
as
an
independent
division
of
his
company
,
with
current
management
remaining
in
place
.

He
does
not
expect
layoffs
.

With
more
than
6,800
employees
,
Snyder
had
$
333.4
million
in
revenue
last
year
and
a
net
loss
of
$
8.2
million
.

Excluding
charges
related
to
various
acquisitions
,
the
company
had
net
income
of
$
26.9
million
.

Analysts
project
its
1998
sales
will
exceed
$
600
million
.

Also
yesterday
,
the
Bethesda
company
said
it
acquired
Publimed
Promotions
SA
,
a
Paris
-
based
contract
drug
sales
and
marketing
company
,
for
$
43
million
in
stock
.

The
purchase
adds
925
people
to
Snyder
's
pharmaceutical
sales
force
,
giving
the
company
nearly
4,000
sales
representatives
.

News
of
the
two
purchases
sent
Snyder
's
stock
up
$
2.75
to
close
at
$
46 5/8
yesterday
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

The
Arnold
and
Publimed
acquisitions
cap
a
string
of
such
deals
for
Snyder
,
which
spent
more
than
$
400
million
to
buy
12
companies
in
1997
.

It
has
bought
four
companies
so
far
this
year
.

Bernstein
,
the
Merrill
Lynch
analyst
,
said
she
raised
her
earnings-per-share
estimates
from
84
cents
to
90
cents
this
year
and
from
$
1.25
to
$
1.31
in
1999
.

Her
12-month
price
objective
is
now
$
58
a
share
,
up
from
$
50
a
share
.

MOSCOW
(
AP
)
_
Two
Russians
and
a
Frenchman
left
the
Mir
and
endured
a
rough
landing
on
the
snow-covered
plains
of
Central
Asia
on
Thursday
.

But
no
one
was
hurt
as
the
crew
completed
a
successful
mission
on
the
12th
anniversary
of
the
space
station
's
launch
.

Cosmonauts
Anatoly
Solovyov
and
Pavel
Vinogradov
and
French
astronaut
Leopold
Eyharts
were
briefly
buffeted
about
in
their
Soyuz
space
capsule
when
they
touched
down
in
the
empty
steppe
of
central
Kazakstan
,
the
ITAR-Tass
news
agency
reported
,
citing
Mission
Control
officials
.

It
took
the
crew
three
hours
to
descend
from
the
Mir
,
400
kilometers
(
250
miles
)
above
Earth
.

Space
officials
were
worried
beforehand
about
a
blizzard
that
raged
through
former
Soviet
republic
on
Wednesday
evening
and
early
Thursday
.

They
considered
delaying
the
crew
's
return
,
but
gave
the
go-ahead
when
the
weather
improved
.

``
Guys
,
do
n't
you
worry
,
the
weather
is
getting
better
,
''
Mission
Control
Chief
Vladimir
Solovyov
told
the
crew
.

Still
,
strong
winds
at
the
landing
site
dragged
the
tiny
landing
capsule
across
the
steppe
as
it
touched
down
.

Deep
snow
helped
cushion
the
impact
,
ITAR-Tass
reported
.

Immediately
after
the
landing
,
the
trio
was
put
on
a
flight
to
Moscow
for
routine
medical
checkups
.

The
two
Russians
arrived
on
the
Mir
last
August
when
the
troubled
space
station
was
hobbled
by
a
number
of
breakdowns
,
including
a
reduced
power
supply
.

But
Solovyov
and
Vinogradov
performed
several
successful
repair
missions
.

The
station
is
now
back
at
close
to
full
power
and
has
not
had
any
major
problems
in
recent
months
.

Solovyov
,
one
of
the
most
experienced
space
flyers
ever
,
celebrated
his
50th
birthday
during
his
six-month
space
voyage
.

He
completed
his
fifth
mission
on
the
Mir
and
has
now
spent
more
than
20
months
in
space
.

This
was
Vinogradov
's
first
stint
on
the
Mir
,
while
Eyharts
was
aboard
for
the
past
three
weeks
conducting
scientific
experiments
.

The
Mir
was
launched
on
Feb.
19
,
1986
,
and
was
expected
to
remain
in
operation
for
only
five
years
.

A
series
of
near
disasters
last
year
,
including
a
fire
,
computer
breakdowns
,
and
a
collision
with
a
cargo
ship
,
raised
doubts
about
the
Mir
's
safety
.

But
Russian
space
officials
want
to
keep
the
spacecraft
manned
at
least
until
next
year
,
when
an
new
international
space
station
is
put
aloft
.

Russians
Talgat
Musabayev
and
Nikolai
Budarin
and
American
Andrew
Thomas
remain
aboard
the
Mir
.

CANBERRA
,
Australia
(
AP
)
_
Turning
its
back
on
210
years
of
loyalty
to
the
British
royal
family
,
a
constitutional
convention
voted
overwhelmingly
Friday
to
make
Australia
a
republic
under
its
own
president
.

Prime
Minister
John
Howard
,
a
monarchist
himself
,
promised
to
put
the
question
to
a
national
referendum
next
year
after
convention
delegates
voted
89-52
for
a
republic
,
with
11
abstentions
.

Spontaneous
applause
echoed
through
the
chamber
and
public
galleries
as
the
crucial
vote
passed
by
a
wide
margin
.

``
I
want
a
referendum
,
''
Howard
said
.

``
The
Australian
people
are
owed
the
opportunity
of
expressing
an
opinion
on
this
.
''

``
It
would
be
a
travesty
in
common
sense
terms
of
Australian
democracy
for
that
proposition
not
to
be
put
to
the
Australian
people
,
''
Howard
said
.

Even
in
his
own
Cabinet
,
Howard
is
becoming
increasingly
isolated
with
his
monarchist
stance
.

Treasurer
Peter
Costello
,
Environment
Minister
Robert
Hill
and
Attorney
General
Daryl
Williams
all
voted
to
support
the
republic
Friday
.

``
This
convention
will
be
seen
as
a
turning
point
in
our
history
,
''
Australian
Republican
Movement
spokeswoman
Mary
Delahunty
said
.

Pro-republicans
hope
to
have
an
Australian
president
by
the
opening
of
the
2000
Olympics
and
the
100th
anniversary
of
Australian
federation
.

Calling
for
an
amended
constitution
with
a
new
preamble
,
to
be
written
by
Australian
poets
,
republican
Janet
Holmes
a
Court
said
,
``
We
need
the
smell
of
eucalyptus
in
this
,
and
the
feel
of
red
dust
.
''

Monarchists
hope
to
defeat
the
republic
at
the
referendum
.

``
The
phony
war
has
finished
and
the
real
referendum
campaign
has
clearly
begun
,
''
Australians
for
a
Constitutional
Monarchy
executive
director
Kerry
Jones
said
.

``
Well
may
we
say
`
God
save
the
Queen
,
'
for
nothing
will
save
the
republic
,
''
outraged
monarchist
delegate
David
Mitchell
said
.

``
The
idea
of
a
republic
will
fall
to
dust
through
the
grace
of
almighty
God
.
''

Polls
have
shown
public
support
for
a
republic
increasing
,
rising
from
about
35
percent
several
years
ago
to
about
51
percent
this
year
,
as
pro-monarchist
sentiment
diminishes
.

Australia
has
been
independent
since
1901
,
but
like
many
Commonwealth
nations
it
still
recognizes
the
British
monarch
as
its
head
of
state
.

Howard
said
Queen
Elizabeth
II
is
taking
a
great
interest
in
the
convention
.

``
She
is
,
I
can
assure
you
,
from
what
I
've
been
told
,
she
's
following
the
thing
very
closely
and
taking
the
view
it
's
our
business
.

``
It
's
no
secret
that
she
's
indicated
to
me
...
she
is
a
20th
century
democrat
,
understands
that
the
role
of
the
crown
in
Australia
rests
in
the
hands
of
the
Australian
people
as
it
has
for
almost
a
hundred
years
.
''

The
model
for
a
republic
,
adopted
over
bitter
objections
from
those
advocating
direct
election
of
a
president
,
is
for
presidential
nominations
to
be
made
with
public
input
and
the
winning
candidate
decided
by
a
two-thirds
majority
of
Parliament
.

Former
prime
minister
Paul
Keating
,
who
put
the
republic
issue
in
the
spotlight
in
his
unsuccessful
1996
campaign
for
re-election
,
welcomed
the
result
.

``
This
is
an
important
step
along
the
path
towards
Australia
claiming
its
full
sovereignty
,
and
due
recognition
that
the
monarchy
can
no
longer
serve
us
appropriately
,
''
Keating
said
.

WASHINGTON
_
Following
are
excerpts
of
a
deposition
of
former
White
House
volunteer
Kathleen
Willey
given
Jan.
11
in
the
sexual
harassment
case
of
Paula
Jones
.

Ms.
Willey
was
questioned
by
Robert
Bennett
,
the
president
's
lawyer
,
and
Daniel
Gecker
,
her
lawyer
.

The
deposition
was
made
public
Friday
by
lawyers
for
Mrs.
Jones
.

Q.
Can
you
tell
us
how
the
meeting
in
the
private
office
concluded
?

A.
I
think
I
said
,
``
I
've
taken
enough
of
your
time
and
thank
you
for
listening
.
''

Q.
And
did
he
say
anything
back
to
you
?

A.
I

he
said
he
was
sorry
that
I
was
having
the
problems
_
that
we
were
having
the
problems
we
were
having
.

Q.
Is

he
said
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
And

what
did
you
do
?

A.
Then
I
turned
to
leave
.

Q.
And
after
you
turned
to
leave
,
what
happened
?

A.
Well
,
we
got
to
the
door
back
into
the
Oval
Office
.

We
got
to
that
door
.

Q.
By
walking
back
down
the
same
hall
?

A.
Uh-huh
.

Q.
And
then
what
happened
?

A.
Then
he
hugged
me
again
and
said
that
they
would
try
to
help
me
.

Q.
And
was
that
at
the
door
in
the
private
hallway
leading
back
into
the
Oval
Office
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
And

was
a
hug
.

an
embrace
?

A.
It
was
a
hug
.

Q.
Can
you
describe
it
any
more
fully
that
that
?

A.
Just
a
big
hug
.

Q.
Did
you
hug
him
back
?

A.
I
think
so
.

I
mean
,
I
think
so
.

I
mean
,
I
do
n't
really
recall
if
I
did
or
not
.
.

...
Q.
After
that
hug
,
what
happened
after
that
?

A.
Well
,
it
continued
.

Q.
OK
.

Please
describe
exactly
how
it
continued
.

A.
The
hug
just
continued
longer
than
I
expected
.

Q.
Can
you
give
us
an
estimation
as
to
how
long
the
hug
continued
?

A.
No.
Q.
It
was

all
afternoon
;
is
that
correct
?

A.
All
afternoon
?

Q.
It
was
not

A.
No.
Q.
OK

Was
it
as
long
as
a
minute
?

A.
I
really
do
n't
know
.

Q.
Was
there
any
kissing
involved
in
that
hug
?

A.
There
was
an

A.
Surprise

A.
I
do
n't
think
so
.

Q.
Was
he
successful
in
kissing
you
?

A.
I
ca
n't
remember
.

Q.
It
could
be
that

was
successful
?

A.
It
could
be
that
he
was
n't
.

I

remember
.

Q.

that
the
only
_

there
only
one

A.
Yes

Q.
Did
you
ever
attempt
to
kiss
him
back
?

No.
Q.
During
the
time
period
that
this
hug
went
on
longer
than
you
expected
,
as
you
said
,
was
there
any
other
attempt
physically
on
his
part
to
touch
you
?

A.
Well
,
he
had
his
arms
around
me
.

Q.
Other
than
having
his
arms
around
your
back
_
is
that
right
?

A.
Right
.

Q.
Did
he
ever
move
his
arms
to
any
other
portion
on
your
body
?

A.
I
do
n't
recall
.

Q.
Is
it
possible
he
did

A.
I
do
n't
recall
.

Q.
Is
it
possible
that
he
did
?

A.
I
do
n't
recall
.

Mr.
Campbell
:
Judge
,
I
'm
going
to
have
to
object
as
nonresponsive
.

The
Court
:
Well
,
I
suppose
anything
is
possible
,
but
do
you
have
any
recollection
of
him
touching
you
other
than
the
hug
regardless
of
whether
it
was
two
seconds
or
10
seconds
?

That
's
what
Mr.
Campbell
wants
to
know
.

The
Deponent
:
Restate
the
question
,
please
.

Mr.
Campbell
:
Would
you
read
it
back
,
please
?

The

''
)

By
Mr.
Campbell
:
Q.
So
the
question
is
,
Ma'am
,
is
it
possible
that
Mr.
Clinton
ever
moved
his
hands
to
any
portion
of
your
body
other
than
your
back
?

Mr.
Bennett
:
I
object
to
the
form
of
the
question
.

I
mean
,
I
do
n't
know
_
The
Court
:
...
Ms.
Willey
,
you
're
hesitating
and
I
can
understand
that
.

I
suspect
you
're
trying
to
think
about
it
so
that
you
are
perfectly
honest
in
your
responses
.

I
think
what
Mr.
Campbell
wants
to
know
is
if
there
was
any
physical
contact
between
you
and
the
president
which
had
a
sexual
connotation
,
and
I
think
you
can
answer
that
.

Is
that
_
Mr.
Campbell
:
I
'll
accept
that
question
,
Your
Honor
.

The
Court
:
And
if
there
was
n't
,
say
so
.

If
there
was
,
say
yes
and
describe
it
.

Ms.
Willey
:
I
think
that
's
where
he
was
going
.

The
Court
:
What
's
that
,
Ma'am
?

Ms.
Willey
:
I
think
that
's
where
he
was
going
.

The
Court
:
No
,
I
think
what
Mr.
Campbell
is
interested
in
is
where
did
he
go
?

By
Mr.
Campbell
:
Q.
Yes
.

What
's
the
basis
for
you
saying
,
``
I
think
that
's
where
he
was
going
''
?

A.
It
's
just
a
feeling
I
had
.

Q.
Can
you
tell
me
how
you
got
that
feeling
?

A.
I
felt
like
it
was
more
than
just
a
platonic
hug
.

Q.
Can
you
give
us
any
more
specifics
as
to
why
you
felt
that
way
?

A.
No.
Q.
What
were
you
wearing
on
that
occasion
?

A.
I
do
n't
have
the
faintest
idea
.

Q.
Can
you
tell
us
whether
it
was
a
dress
or
pants
?

A.
I
do
n't
remember
.

Q.
Did
Mr.
Clinton
ever
place
his
hands
on
any
part
of
your
legs
?

A.
No.
Q.
Did
Mr.
Clinton
ever
place
his
hands
on
any
part
of
your
buttocks
?

A.
I
do
n't
remember
.

Q.
You
do
n't
remember
?

A.
(
Deponent
shaking
head
)
.

Q.
So
you
can
not
say
_
A.
I
can
not
recall
.

Q.
You
ca
n't
categorically
say
he
did
not
;
is
that
correct
?

A.
Correct
.

Q.
Did
Mr.
Clinton
ever
seek
to
take
either
of
your
hands
and
place
it
on
his
body
anyplace
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
Please
describe
that
.

Mr.
Gecker
:
Judge
,
I
hate
to
be
the
one
to
do
this
,
but
is
it
possible
that
we
could
excuse
those
folks
who
are
n't
necessary
for
this
part
of
the
deposition
?

The
Court
:
Oh
,
sure
.

You
can
take
a
five-minute
recess
if
you
'd
like
and
you
can
talk
.

I
'm
not
necessary
.

Mr.
Gecker
:
I
do
n't
need
a
recess
,
Judge
,
but
I
'm
trying
to
be
as
polite
as
I
can
.

The
Court
:
There
's
no
need
for
me
to
be
in
here
.

Mr.
Gecker
:
As
much
as
I
like
your
law
clerks
_
The
Court
:
There
's
no
need
for
me
to
be
in
here
.

Mr.
Bennett
:
I
think
Your
Honor
should
be
here
.

The
Court
:
Then
I
'll
ask
the
ladies
to
leave
.

Mr.
Gecker
:
With
all
due
respect
to
them
,
I
apologize
.

The
Court
:
That
's
no
problem
.

We
just
want
her
to
be
comfortable
.

Mr.
Campbell
:
That
's
fine
.

Mr.
Gecker
:
Do
you
want
to
take
a
break
?

The
Court
:
Do
you
want
a
break
,
Ms.
Willey
?

Ms.
Willey
:
Yes
.

The
Court
:
Then
we
'll
take
a
break
.

(
A
break
was
taken
.
)

Mr.
Campbell
:
Would
you
read
my
last
question
back
,
please
?

(
The

reporter
read
back
the

The
Court

Were

A.
I
do

recall
.

I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
``
immediate
.
''

Q.
Well
,
were
you
able
to
remove
your
hand
from
his
genital
area
within
a
second
or
two
?

A.
Probably
.

Q.
Could
you
tell
whether
he
was
aroused
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
And
was
he
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
After
you
withdrew
your
hand
from
his
genital
area
,
what
's
the
next
physical
thing
that
happened
during
that
encounter
?

A.
I
left
.

Q.
Before
you
left
,
did
he
attempt
to
kiss
you
again
?

A.
No.
Q.
Did
he
attempt
to
take
either
of
your
hands
again
?

A.
No.
Q.
Did
he
attempt

again

release
from

in
order
to
leave
the
room
?

A.
Yes

Q.
And
how
did
you
accomplish
that
?

A.
I
just
got
out
from
his
embrace
.

Q.
Did

ever
have
to
physically

I
do
n't
recall
.

recall
whether
you
had
to
struggle
at
all
?

A.
No.
Mr.
Bennett
:
Well
,
I
'm
sorry
_
no
,
you
do
n't
recall
or
,
no
,
you
did
n't
have
to
struggle
?

The
Deponent
:
No
,
there
was
not
a
struggle
.

I
do
n't
think
there
was
a
struggle
.

By
Mr.
Campbell
:
Q.
Was
there
any
type
of
resistance
on
his
part
to
letting
you
go
?

Any
type
?

A.
I
ca
n't
judge
that
.

...
Q.
Did
Mr.
Clinton
attempt
to
touch
your
breasts
?

A.
I
think
so
.

Q.
And
what
's
the
basis
for
your
thinking
so
?

A.
I
have
a
recollection
of
that
.

Q.
Was
he
successful
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
With
one
hand
or
both
hands
?

A.
I
do
n't
recall
.

Q.
And
can
you
give
me
any
time
concept
as
to
how
long
that
contact
took
place
?

A.
No.
Q.
Was
that
during
this
hug
incident
that
we
're
talking
about
right
now
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
And
that
occurred
before
you
broke
away
from
him
;
is
that
correct
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
Can
you
tell
us
whether
the
touching
of
your
breasts
occurred
before
or
after
Mr.
Clinton
took
your
hand
and
put
it
on
his
genitals
?

A.
I
do
n't
recall
.

Q.
At
the
time
beginning
with
the
time
that
you
broke
away
from
Mr.
Clinton
until
the
time
you
exited
his
presence
,
did
you
(
illegible
)
anything
to
him
?

A.
I
think
I
expressed
surprise
.

Q.
Can
you
recall
anything
else
that
you
expressed
to
him
?

A.
No.
Q.
Did
you
ask
him
to
stop
?

A.
I
do
n't
think
I
verbally
did
.

Q.
Do
you
think
you
did
non-verbally
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
By
what
?

A.
By
resisting
.

...
Q.
When
you
broke
away
and
started
your
exit
,
please
tell
us
exactly
how
you
accomplished
the
exit
.

A.
I
opened
the
door
.

Q.
You
opened
the
door
from
the
private
hallway
into
the
Oval
Office
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
And
you
went
into
the
Oval
Office
;
is
that
right
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
And
then
where
did
you
go
?

A.
I
stood
in
front
of
his
desk
.

Q.
And
then
what
happened
?

A.
He
sat
down
behind
his
desk
.

Q.
So
is
it
correct
that
Mr.
Clinton
came
back
into
the
Oval
Office
proper
,
went
behind
his
desk
and
sat
down
behind
his
desk
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
And
you
stood
or
sat
in
front
of
his
desk
?

A.
Stood
.

Q.
And
then
what
happened
?

A.
I
left
.

Q.
How
long
did
you
stand
there
?

A.
I
do
n't
recall
.

Q.
A
short
period
of
time
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
Did
you
say
anything
to
him
during
that
period
of
time
?

A.
I
think
I
thanked
him
for
taking
the
time
to
talk
to
me
.

Q.
Do
you
recall
saying
anything
else
to
him
during
that
time
?

A.
No.
Q.
Did
he
say
anything
to
you
during
that
time
?

A.
I
do
n't
remember
.

Q.
You
do
n't
recall
one
way
or
the
other
whether
he
said
anything
to
you
as
he
said
...
A.
I
think
he
said
``
goodbye
.
''

I
think
he
responded
to
my
thanking
him
in
some
way
.

I
mean
,
he
did
n't
just
sit
there
.

Q.
Can
you
recall
anything
else
that
he
said
?

A.
No.
I
mean
,
I
just
_
it
was
``
goodbye
''
probably
.

...
Q.
Pardon
me
,
Ma'am
.

Let
me
finish
the
question
.

Did
you
say
anything
to
him
in
reference
to
the
physical
contact
that
had
just
occurred
?

A.
No.
Q.
And
then
after
that
brief
interchange
within
the
Oval
Office
again
,
is
it
correct
that
you
turned
and
left
the
room
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
Did
he
remain
seated
behind
his
desk
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
Was
there
anyone
at
the
door
when
you
exited
?

A.
Yes
.

Q.
Who
was
that
?

A.
I
recall
seeing
I
believe
it
was
Lloyd
Bentsen
.

I
saw
about
six
people
standing
there
.

I
recall
him
and
I
think
Leon
Panetta
.

...

WASHINGTON
_
If
the
man
accused
of
killing
seven
people
near
Boston
on
Tuesday
got
his
guns
in
Massachusetts
,
he
was
able
to
skirt
some
of
the
strictest
regulations
in
the
country
,
people
familiar
with
the
state
's
laws
said
Wednesday
.

Investigators
said
Wednesday
that
the
suspect
,
Michael
McDermott
,
did
not
have
a
permit
for
any
of
the
four
weapons
he
took
with
him
to
work
.

Without
the
permits
,
he
was
breaking
Massachusetts
law
just
by
having
the
weapons
.

The
state
requires
a
permit
,
formally
known
as
a
``
firearm
identification
card
,
''
for
purchase
of
virtually
every
kind
of
firearm
,
whether
for
personal
protection
or
hunting
.

An
additional
permit
,
which
may
specify
restrictions
,
is
needed
to
carry
a
concealed
weapon
.

Identification
cards
are
issued
by
the
local
police
and
may
take
up
to
30
days
to
obtain
while
an
applicant
's
background
is
checked
.

Even
if
a
background
check
turns
up
no
convictions
for
serious
crimes
,
which
would
make
it
all
but
impossible
for
an
applicant
to
get
a
card
,
the
police
have
considerable
discretion
on
whether
to
issue
them
.

While
investigators
said
they
did
not
yet
know
where
the
Massachusetts
-
born
suspect
got
his
guns
,
Scott
Harshbarger
,
the
former
state
attorney
general
who
pushed
for
more
stringent
state
gun-control
rules
in
the
late
1990s
,
said
,
``
This
is
where
you
'll
see
if
the
tracing
system
works
.
''

A
recent
federal
study
showed
that
up
to
70
percent
of
guns
found
to
have
been
used
in
crimes
in
Boston
actually
came
from
out
of
state
,
especially
Georgia
,
Virginia
and
other
Southern
states
,
Daniel
Webster
,
an
assistant
professor
of
health
policy
at
the
Johns
Hopkins
Center
for
Gun
Policy
and
Research
,
said
Wednesday
.

Violations
of
the
Massachusetts
laws
carry
fines
of
several
thousand
dollars
and
up
to
10
years
in
prison
.

Webster
said
other
states
closer
to
Massachusetts
,
notably
Vermont
and
New
Hampshire
,
have
looser
gun
regulations
than
Massachusetts
,
a
view
Harshbarger
did
not
dispute
.

The
authorities
said
McDermott
used
a
12-gauge
shotgun
and
an
``
AK-47
style
''
semiautomatic
rifle
to
kill
his
co-workers
,
and
that
he
was
also
carrying
a
semiautomatic
handgun
.

Investigators
later
found
a
.460
Magnum
rifle
with
a
telescopic
sight
in
the
suspect
's
locker
at
work
.

A
true
AK-47
,
which
can
fire
``
fully
automatic
''
like
a
machine
gun
,
is

as
an
assault
weapon

a
state
permit

be
difficult

not
impossible
to
obtain

Harshbarger
said
,
while
a
semiautomatic
rifle
(
one
shot
per
trigger
pull
)
modeled
after
an
AK-47
might
be
permissible
.

Massachusetts
,
like
many
states
,
requires
a
special
permit
to
carry
a
handgun
.

The
.460
Magnum
,
manufactured
by
Weatherby
Inc.
of
Atascadero
,
Calif.
,
is
a
bolt-action
rifle
and
one
of
the
most
powerful
shoulder-fired
weapons
in
the
world
.

It
is
``
the
only
choice
for
Africa
's
most
dangerous
game
,
''
according
to
the
manufacturer
.

A
top-of-the-line
.460
Magnum
can
cost
close
to
$
6,000
.

While
it
is
not
illegal
to
own
one
in
Massachusetts
,
there
is
no
big
game
in
that
state
_
and
probably
none
in
North
America
_
that
demands
its
stopping
power
.

A
longtime
Virginia
gun
dealer
said
Wednesday
he
had
sold
two
in
the
past
five
years
,
and
that
its
recoil
is
simply
too
punishing
for
many
shooters
.

In
many
states
,
a
person
can
buy
a
12-gauge
shotgun
,
a
widely
used
hunting
weapon
,
as
easily
as
a
fishing
rod
.

But
in
Massachusetts
,
a
shotgun
purchase
requires
a
firearm
identification
card
.

Harshbarger
,
who
is
now
president
and
chief
executive
of
Common
Cause
,
a
lobbying
organization
,
said
the
slaughter
in
Wakefield
``
shows
that
even
the
toughest

n't
prevent
every
type

Walt
Disney
Co.
is
negotiating
to
buy
WJLA
(
Channel
7
)
in
Washington
and
seven
other
TV
stations
across
the
country
owned
by
broadcasting
and
banking
magnate
Joe
L.
Allbritton
,
sources
said
yesterday
.

If
the
negotiations
are
successful
,
Disney
-
owned
ABC
would
take
over
management
of
WJLA
,
the
local
ABC
affiliate
,
and
establish
it
as
the
Washington
base
for
the
network
,
which
already
owns
stations
in
10
other
major
cities
including
New
York
,
Chicago
and
Los
Angeles
.

Allbritton
Communications
'
stations
could
fetch
$
750
million
to
$
900
million
,
according
to
rough
valuations
by
industry
sources
.

"
Yeah
,
we
're
interested
,
"
said
an
ABC
executive
who
did
not
want
to
be
identified
.

The
executive
said
ABC
does
not
publicly
discuss
possible
acquisitions
.

Disney
,
like
other
broadcasting
networks
,
is
eager
to
buy
local
stations
,
which
are
the
most
profitable
part
of
the
television
business
.

The
ABC
network
is
ailing
and
anticipates
losses
this
year
,
though
such
losses
are
more
than
offset
by
strong
profits
of
the
local
stations
ABC
owns
and
operates
.

Allbritton
's
TV
empire
is
attractive
because
it
is
one
of
the
few
remaining
groups
of
ABC
affiliates
that
Disney
could
purchase
.

Federal
deregulation
of
the
broadcasting
business
in
1996
raised
limits
on
the
number
of
stations
that
a
single
company
can
own
.

It
set
off
a
buying
frenzy
,
which
has
driven
the
price
of
television
stations
to
record
levels
.

Allbritton
,
72
,
owns
Allbritton
Communications
Corp.
and
has
a
controlling
interest
in
Riggs
National
Corp.
of
Washington
,
the
parent
company
of
Riggs
Bank
.

He
has
been
approached
repeatedly
about
selling
the
bank
,
but
has
rejected
the
offers
.

Price
could
be
the
crucial
factor
in
negotiations
for
the
television
stations
.

Both
Disney
and
Allbritton
are
known
as
hard
bargainers
.

Allbritton
and
his
son
,
Robert
,
28
,
chief
operating
officer
of
Allbritton
Communications
,
were
in
London
yesterday
for
the
annual
shareholders
meeting
of
Riggs
AP
Bank
,
a
British
affiliate
of
Riggs
National
Bank
,
and
could
not
be
reached
for
comment
.

Jerald
Fritz
,
general
counsel
of
Allbritton
Communications
,
said
the
company
does
not
comment
on
rumors
or
media
reports
.

Through
a
separate
company
,
Allbritton
also
owns
Newschannel
8
,
the
Washington
all-news
cable
channel
.

Industry
sources
said
Newschannel
8
,
a
six-year-old
local
station
that
has
yet
to
turn
a
profit
,
is
included
in
the
package
Disney
is
negotiating
to
buy
.

Allbritton
Communications
owns
six
other
ABC
affiliates
,
in
Lynchburg
,
Va.
;
Tulsa
,
Okla.
;
Harrisburg
,
Pa.
;
Charleston
,
S.C.
;
Tuscaloosa
,
Ala.
;
and
Little
Rock
.

It
owns
a
low-power
station
in
Alabama
and
manages
another
station
that
serves
the
Tuscaloosa
-
Birmingham
market
.

WJLA
--
which
stands
for
Joe
L.
Allbritton
--
is
the
big
prize
in
Allbritton
's
empire
,
accounting
for
half
the
$
173
million
in
revenue
the
company
reported
last
year
.

The
stations
generated
almost
$
62.8
million
in
operating
cash
flow
last
year
,
and
reported
a
loss
of
$
3
million
for
the
six
months
ended
March
31
.

Industry
analysts
say
cash
flow
is
a
better
measure
of
a
TV
station
's
performance
than
profits
and
is
the
factor
used
to
determine
prices
.

Stations
recently
have
been
selling
for
12
to
15
times
annual
cash
flow
,
which
would
place
the
value
of
Allbritton
Communications
'
stations
in
the
$
750
million
to
$
900
million
range
.

Washington
has
been
a
relatively
poor
market
for
ABC
,
primarily
because
WJLA
's
lagging
local
newscast
has
had
poor
ratings
,
which
have
translated
into
smaller
audiences
and
advertising
rates
for
the
network
's
shows
.

ABC
counts
on
local
news
as
a
"
lead-in
"
for
its
"
World
News
Tonight
With
Peter
Jennings
"
and
other
programming
.

WJLA
's
5
p.m.
newscast
,
anchored
by
Paul
Berry
and
Kathleen
Mathews
,
finished
third
in
the
ratings
during
the
May
"
sweeps
,
"
despite
being
preceded
by
Oprah
Winfrey
's
hugely
popular
talk
show
.

Its
6
p.m.
news
also
ranked
third
,
behind
WRC
(
Channel
4
)
and
WUSA
(
Channel
9
)
,
and
was
tied
for
second
at
11
p.m.
with
WUSA
,
although
both
were
a
distant
second
to
WRC
at
that
hour
.

If
it
purchases
the
station
,
ABC
would
likely
beef
up
WJLA
's
local
news
operation
to
bolster
ratings
for
the
network
news
.

ABC
owns
stations
in
10
cities
,
covering
about
25
percent
of
the
nation
's
population
,
leaving
it
well
below
the
federal
ownership
limit
of
35
percent
of
the
population

ROME
_
In
an
encounter
bracketed
by
political
clashes
and
public
protest
,
Pope
John
Paul
II
met
briefly
on
Saturday
at
the
Vatican
with
Joerg
Haider
,
the
far-right
Austrian
politician
,
who
is
persona
non
grata
to
many
Europeans
.

Haider
,
leading
a
group
of
250
Austrians
and
presenting
a
gift
of
an
80-foot
Christmas
tree
from
Carinthia
,
the
state
of
which
he
is
governor
,
did
not
receive
a
private
audience
with
the
pope
.

The
Vatican
spokesman
,
Joaquin
Navarro-Valls
,
explained
that
Haider
and
Bishop
Egon
Kapellari
of
Carinthia
spoke
with
the
pope
for
a
few
minutes
before
the
meeting
only
to
exchange
greetings
.

But
Haider
,
who
seems
to
relish
even
hostile
attention
,
walked
across
St.
Peter
's
Square
to
the
Vatican
from
his
nearby
hotel
separately
from
the
rest
of
the
delegation
,
which
included
his
wife
and
two
children
.

He
was
surrounded
by
a
tense
phalanx
of
security
officers
and
jostling
cameramen
.

For
weeks
Italian
Jewish
groups
,
World
War
II
veterans
and
leftist
political
parties
have
staged
protests
against
a
meeting
between
the
pope
and
Haider
,
arguing
that
a
papal
encounter
would
lend
the
Austrian
politician
legitimacy
.

On
Saturday
,
about
1,000
students
marched
in
another
section
of
central
Rome
,
carrying
banners
that
read
``
Haider
?

No
thank
you
.
''

No
demonstrations
were
allowed
near
St.
Peter
's
,
and
security
around
the
tree
,
which
was
erected
in
the
middle
of
St.
Peter
's
Square
,
was
discreetly
tightened
.

After
Haider
left
the
area
,
scores
of
protesters
clashed
with
riot
police
,
who
fired
tear
gas
to
disperse
the
crowds
.

Four
people
were
slightly
injured
and
two
were
detained
,
the
Italian
news
agency
ANSA
said
.

Jewish
merchants
in
Rome
announced
they
would
turn
off
their
lights
to
protest
Haider
's
presence
in
Rome
.

When
reporters
asked
Haider
about
this
action
,
he
retorted
,
``
If
they
want
to
save
electricity
,
let
them
.
''

Inside
an
ornate
reception
room
in
the
papal
apartments
,
Haider
,
a
Roman
Catholic
,
kissed
the
pope
's
ring
and
sat
in
the
front
row
with
other
dignitaries
facing
the
pope
's
armchair
.

Haider
wore
a
blue
business
suit
,
but
many
in
his
group
wore
traditional
costumes
and
sang
Christmas
carols
.

The
pope
thanked
the
visitors
for
the
tree
but
made
no
mention
of
such
issues
as
racism
and
immigration
,
which
have
tracked
Haider
's
tense
visit
to
Italy
.

A
copy
of
the
pope
's
recently
released
New
Year
's
Day
message
of
peace
,
which
calls
for
countries
to
welcome
immigrants
and
avoid
intolerance
,
was
distributed
to
leaders
of
the
delegation
.

After
the
meeting
,
Haider
told
reporters
that
he
had
not
discussed
political
issues
with
the
pope
,
that
John
Paul
II
had
given
the
group
a
``
warm
welcome
''
and
that
``
he
seemed
very
happy
with
the
gift
.
''

Indeed
,
in
the
past
the
pope
has
stirred
controversy
by
meeting
with
former
U.N.
secretary-general
Kurt
Waldheim
,
whose
activities
in
the
Nazi
era
came
under
question
,
and
Fidel
Castro
.

When
Haider
arrived
in
Venice
earlier
this
week
,
protesters
on
boats
threw
stones
and
fireworks
along
the
canals
.

Haider
's
comments
criticizing
Italy
's
immigration
policy
as
``
too
generous
''
were
denounced
by
President
Carlo
Azeglio
Ciampi
.

The
comments
set
off
an
election
campaign
storm
,
as
leaders
of
Italy
's
left-wing
government
leveraged
the
dislike
of
Haider
to
cast
a
shadow
on
Italy
's
own
right-wing
parties
.

The
coalition
of
Italy
's
center-right
opposition
includes
the
formerly
separatist
and
still
fiercely
right-wing
party
,
the
Northern
League
,
which
,
like
Haider
's
Freedom
Party
,
opposes
immigration
.

On
Friday
,
Prime
Minister
Giuliano
Amato
denounced
Haider
's
comments
as
``
unacceptable
''
and
said
he
would
complain
to
Chancellor
Wolfgang
Schuessel
of
Austria
.

Italy
is
not
the
only
European
country
to
have
fierce
reservations
about
Haider
,
but
it
has
had
more
direct
exposure
.

The
Austrian
leader
has
made
several
visits
to
northern
Italy
,
where
his
friendship
with
some
right-wing
mayors
_
and
suggestions
that
southern
Austria
and
parts
of
northern
Italy
should
merge
into
a
``
maxi-region
''
_
have
enraged
Italy
's
center-left
government
.

Some
people
in
Haider
's
delegation
said
they
were
disappointed
by
the
clamor
surrounding
Saturday
's
visit
.

``
The
Christmas
tree

a

.

``
I
did

vote
for
Haider
,
but
this
is
not
about
him
.

It
is
about
Christmas

NICE
,
France
(
AP
)
_
One
after
another
,
late
into
the
night
,
the
leaders
of
Europe
filed
into
a
small
,
windowless
room
for
private
chats
with
French
President
Jacques
Chirac
that
could
determine
the
future
of
the
European
Union
.

Chirac
was
fighting
to
break
a
deadlock
over
how
to
modify
the
15-nation
EU
's
decision-making
mechanisms
to
cope
with
its
planned
expansion
into
the
former
communist
East
.

On
Saturday
morning
,
after
he
'd
finished
seeing
the
other
14
EU
leaders
,
Chirac
was
scheduled
to
send
them
a
draft
Treaty
of
Nice
_
a
blueprint
for
running
the
bloc
of
370
million
people
as
it
prepares
for
a
dozen
new
members
.

His
efforts
,
which
took
place
in
the
midst
of
a
crucial
three-day
EU
summit
in
this
French
resort
city
,
were
a
step
toward
the
agreement
that
everyone
gathered
here
says
is
necessary
_
but
nobody
thinks
will
be
easy
.

``
Everybody
has
to
be
prepared
to
take
a
step
toward
compromise
,
''
Chirac
told
a
news
conference
as
he
prepared
to
host
the
talks
.

Failure
to
find
an
agreement
before
the
summit
ends
could
push
the
EU
into
a
prolonged
crisis
and
dash
the
hopes
of
Poles
,
Hungarians
,
Czechs
and
others
seeking
to
join
the
EU
over
the
next
two
or
three
years
.

Painfully
aware
of
the
high
stakes
,
leaders
were
hopeful
an
agreement
could
be
reached
as
the
summit
,
which
started
Thursday
,
drags
on
through
the
weekend
.

``
I
do
n't
want
to
speculate
about
failure
,
''
Swedish
Prime
Minister
Goeran
Persson
told
reporters
after
his
15-minute
meeting
with
Chirac
.

``
I
do
n't
think
that
is
in
the
cards
.

All
political
logic
tells
me
we
'll
finally
find
an
agreement
over
how
to
distribute
power
.
''

Chirac
has
a
particular
problem
.

As
the
EU
's
current
chairman
,
he
's
supposed
to
broker
a
compromise
.

But
he
's
also
defending
France
's
corner
in
a
fight
with
Germany
_
the
summit
's
knottiest
problem
.

Although
every
nation
is
fighting
to
maximize
its
voice
in
the
reformed
union
,
other
leaders
believe
summit
success
hinges
on
resolving
the
wrangle
between
Paris
and
Berlin
over
who
controls
the
most
votes
in
the
EU
's
policy-setting
councils
.

Germany
,
its
population
swollen
to
82
million
by
reunification
,
wants
its
voting
weight
increased
to
reflect
its
position
as
the
EU
's
biggest
nation
.

France
says
that
strikes
at
the
heart
of
postwar
Franco
-
German
parity
,
which
formed
the
foundation
of
Europe
's
drive
for
unity
.

Paris
defends
a
status
quo
that
gives
Germany
equal
voting
rights
with
France
,
Italy
and
Britain
even
though
they
each
have
fewer
than
60
million
citizens
.

Meanwhile
,
smaller
nations
are
struggling
to
avoid
having
their
rights
overwhelmed
by
the
maneuvers
of
the
``
big
four
.
''

Although
no
early
breakthrough
was
in
sight
,
leaders
hinted
the
group
was
edging
toward
a
deal
.

``
I
came
away
reasonably
optimistic
,
''
French
Prime
Minister
Lionel
Jospin
said
after
one
round
of
talks
Thursday
.

``
We
ca
n't
say
there
was
movement
,
but
maybe
there
was
a
willingness
to
move
.
''

Suggestions
of
compromise
appeared
on
the
contentious
issue
of
how
many
seats
each
nation
has
on
the
EU
's
executive
body
,
the
European
Commission
.

To
prevent
the
Commission
from
becoming
top-heavy
after
the
expansion
,
bigger
nations
have
agreed
to
give
up
their
second
seat
,
so
all
will
have
one
each
.

Plans
to
go
beyond
that
,
to
introduce
a
rotation
where
some
would
be
temporarily
without
a
seat
,
were
likely
to
be
shelved
.

A
compromise
also
seemed
likely
on
another
central
issue
_
replacing
unanimous
voting
with
majority
decisions

a

of

But
unanimous
decisions
were
expected
to
remain
the
rule
on
the
most
sensitive
topics
,
such
as
taxation
,
immigration
and

Despite

with
their

croissants
Saturday
.

Meanwhile
,
few
felt
like
jeopardizing
the
negotiations
by
going
public
with
the
details
.

``
We
are
in
clerical
sessions

You
know
about

ARLINGTON
,
Texas
(
AP
)
_
One
of
baseball
's
biggest
free-agent
prizes
,
Alex
Rodriguez
is
getting
red-carpet
treatment
from
the
Texas
Rangers
.

And
even
the
Dallas
Stars
are
lending
a
hand
in
trying
to
win
over
the
All-Star
shortstop
.

Rodriguez
and
agent
Scott
Boras
were
expected
to
meet
Monday
with
Rangers
owner
Tom
Hicks
.

He
will
be
joined
by
general
manager
Doug
Melvin
,
manager
Johnny
Oates
and
several
players
.

The
team
's
bid
for
Rodriguez
has
n't
been
slowed
by
the
expected
demand
of
at
least
a
10-year
contract
,
in
the
range
of
$
20
million
a
year
,
loaded
with
fringe
benefits
.

``
We
feel
at
the
expense
of
last
year
,
we
have
our
roster
where
we
do
n't
have
to
trade
people
to
make
this
work
,
''
Melvin
said
in
the
Fort
Worth
Star-Telegram
on
Monday
.

``
I
'm
not
saying
we
have
all
the
money
in
the
world
,
but
we
do
n't
have
to
bust
our
budget
completely
.

We
're
in
a
better
position
than
most
other
clubs
.
''

Stars
center
Mike
Modano
is
being
called
in
to
help
show
Rodriguez
around
the
Dallas-Fort
Worth
area
and
tell
him
why
it
would
be
a
great
place
to
play
.

Melvin
said
he
does
n't
expect
the
Rangers
to
make
a
formal
offer
until
they
can
gauge
the
level
of
interest
from
Rodriguez
.

The
25-year-old
shortstop
,
who
hit
.316
with
41
homers
and
132
RBIs
at
Seattle
last
season
,
also
reportedly
has
been
targeted
by
the
Chicago
White
Sox
,
Los
Angeles
Dodgers
,
New
York
Mets
and
Atlanta
Braves
.

The
Mariners
,
Rodriguez
's
team
the
past
six
years
,
also
wanted
to
re-sign
him
.

``
This
gives
us
a
chance
to
tell
him
about
our
organization
and
the
direction
we
're
going
,
answer
any
questions
they
might
have
about
us
,
''
Melvin
said
.

Some
even
have
a
neighborhood
_
the
fashionable
Dallas
suburb
of
Highland
Park
_
picked
out
for
Rodriguez
.

Neighbors
of
one
available
residence
_
a
five-bedroom
spread
worth
$
11.95
million
_
would
include
Hicks
,
Modano
and
Dallas
Cowboys
owner
Jerry
Jones
.

``
Alex
needs
to
buy
this
house
,
''
Ronda
Needham
,
a
listing
agent
,
told
The
Dallas
Morning
News
.

``
The
people
who
own
this
house
set
it
up
around
their
two
baseball-playing
sons
.

It
's
a
very
sports-minded
house
.
''

The
Mets
,
once
considered
the
favorites
to
get
Rodriguez
,
have
slowed
their
chase
.

General
manager
Steve
Phillips
publicly
criticized
some
of
the
demands
supposedly
made
by
Boras
.

But
the
agent
says
Rodriguez
is
making
no
special
demands
.

``
I
ca
n't
anticipate
any
change
that
would
draw
us
back
into
it
,
''
Phillips
said
.

A
U.S.
judge
in
Texas
Wednesday
temporarily
stayed
his
year-end
decision
that
invalidated
major
portions
of
the
Telecommunications
Act
of
1996
.

Wednesday
's
action
keeps
the
telecommunications
industry
in
the
regulatory
status
it
had
before
Dec.
31
,
when
Judge
Joe
Kendall
of
the
U.S.
District
Court
in
Wichita
Falls
,
Texas
,
ruled
that
local
Bell
telephone
companies
should
be
allowed
to
sell
long-distance
service
without
passing
a
rigorous
review
by
the
Federal
Communications
Commission
.

That
process
was
the
cornerstone
of
the
act
,
and
in
ruling
the
portions
forcing
the
review
unconstitutional
,
the
judge
threw
into
question
the
entire
structure
of
telecommunications
regulation
in
the
United
States
.

Now
,
the
Bells
,
which
had
hoped
to
offer
long
distance
early
this
year
,
must
abide
by
the
language
of
the
act
until
the
judge
's
original
decision
is
considered
by
courts
of
appeal
_
a
process
that
could
take
months
or
years
.

The
act
says
that
the
Bells
,
because
of
their
history
as
part
of
AT&AMP;T
Corp.
,
must
win
special
approvals
from
the
FCC
before
they
may
sell
long-distance
service
.

No
Bell
has
won
such
approval
.

Other
large
local
phone
companies
,
however
,
like
GTE
Corp.
,
are
allowed
to
enter
the
$
80
billion
long-distance
market
without
passing
such
a
rigorous
review
.

In
December
,
Kendall
ruled
that
the
act
violated
the
Constitution
by
essentially
convicting
the
Bells
_
Ameritech
,
Bell
Atlantic
,
BellSouth
,
SBC
Communications
and
US
West
_
of
antitrust
violations
without
a
trial
.

But
Wednesday
the
judge
stayed
the
decision
,
pending
appeal
.

The
FCC
,
along
with
AT&AMP;T
and
MCI
Communications
Corp.
,
has
petitioned
the
5th
U.S.
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
,
based
in
New
Orleans
,
to
hear
the
case
.

Lawyers
involved
in
the
case
said
Wednesday
that
they
did
not
expect
the
appeals
court
to
hear
arguments
in
the
dispute
for
at
least
a
few
months
.

The
lawyers
also
said
that
it
was
unusual
that
Kendall
did
not
explain
his
reason
for
granting
the
stay
.

The
big
long-distance
companies
had
argued
that
they
would
suffer
irreparably
were
the
decision
allowed
to
go
into
effect
.

``
The
Bell
monopolies
must
still
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
telecom
act
before
they
can
enter
the
highly
competitive
long-distance
market
,
''
MCI
said
in
a
statement
.

``
Obviously
we
're
pleased
that
he
granted
the
stay
,
''
added
Peter
Lucht
,
an
MCI
spokesman
.

SBC
Communications
,
the
Bell
that
originally
filed
the
lawsuit
,
played
down
Wednesday
's
action
.

``
The
order
granting
the
stay
is
not
unusual
,
''
the
company
said
in
a
statement
.

`
The
appeals
process
will
be
resolved
quickly
,
and
we
are
confident
that
the
ruling
will
be
upheld
.
''

Kendall
declined
to
issue
an
injunction
specifically
barring
the
Bells
from
selling
long-distance
service
.

But
the
stay
essentially
keeps
the
Bells
out
of
the
long-distance
market
for
the
time
being
.

Even
as
he
granted
the
stay
,
Kendall
stood
by
his
original
decision
,
which
he
said
was
important
to
maintain
the
separation
of
powers
among
the
branches
of
the
federal
government
.

``
Despite
all
the
noise
,
spin
and
reams
of
papers
,
legally
this
case
is
n't
so
much
about
Milt
Friedman
vs.
Kenneth
Galbraith
as
it
is
about
James
Madison
,
''
he
wrote
.

Friedman
is
a
free-market
economist
,
while
John
Kenneth
Galbraith
is
an
economist
who
generally
sees
a
more
positive
role
for
government
intervention
in
the
economy
.

DILI
,
Indonesia
,
June
13
-

More
than
1,000
people
,
including
a
few
aging
resistance
fighters
,
gathered
at
the
University
of
East
Timor
today
in
this
Indonesian
-
occupied
territory
for
a
demonstration
that
was
more
remarkable
for
what
did
not
happen
.

Unlike
in
the
past
,
when
Indonesia
was
ruled
by
former
president
Suharto
,
security
forces
,
for
the
second
time
this
week
,
did
not
harass
protesters
.

Soldiers
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
around
the
campus
as
the
demonstrators
spoke
over
loudspeakers
about
their
desire
for
independence
.

"
Viva
!
"

they
shouted
,
punching
their
fists
into
the
air
.

They
gathered
on
the
back
lawn
of
the
campus
and
some
sat
on
the
school
's
roof
,
unfurling
banners
calling
for
the
release
of
jailed
resistance
leader
Jose
Alexandre
'
Xanana
'
Gusmao
,
or
proclaiming
"
Death
or
independence
!
"

"
This
is
a
golden
chance
for
us
,
"
said
Jovensio
Martinez
,
37
,
who
spent
nearly
seven
years
in
prison
after
a
1991
street
demonstration
during
which
security
forces
shot
and
killed
at
least
50
protesters
.

"
It
's
the
first
chance
we
get
to
express
our
feelings
on
how
to
solve
our
problems
and
decide
our
political
future
,
"
he
said
.
"

We
have
been
crushed
down
for
23
years
.
"

Indonesia
invaded
East
Timor
in
1975
and
annexed
it
the
following
year
.

The
United
Nations
still
recognizes
Portugal
,
East
Timor
's
former
colonial
ruler
,
as
the
territory
's
administrative
authority
.

In
an
interview
today
with
the
Japanese
news
service
Kyodo
,
President
B.J.
Habibie
rejected
independence
for
East
Timor
.
"

The
integration
of
East
Timor
was
accomplished
more
than
20
years
ago
with
the
will
of
the
people
themselves
,
and
there
is
no
going
back
now
,
"
he
said
.

He
had
previously
suggested
granting
the
territory
"
special
status
"
but
the
Timorese
rejected
the
idea
.

The
students
and
most
of
the
general
population
want
a
referendum
to
determine
the
region
's
future
.

Student
protests
ushered
the
fall
of
Suharto
,
who
stepped
down
last
month
after
32
years
in
power
,
but
that
was
not
until
at
least
four
student
demonstrators
were
slain
by
security
forces
.

Massive
rioting
followed
,
prompting
some
of
Suharto
's
key
allies
,
including
members
of
the
military
,
to
abandon
him
.

But
it
is
the
military
here
that
wields
control
,
enjoying
a
certain
amount
of
autonomy
from
the
Indonesian
government
.

The
governor
and
local
military
commanders
have
already
warned
against
demonstrations
.

Soldiers
have
refrained
from
trying
to
prevent
campus
protests
here
,
but
they
broke
up
a
demonstration
Friday
by
East
Timorese
at
the
Foreign
Ministry
in
Jakarta
,
the
Indonesian
capital
.

It
is
unclear
whether
the
military
is
taking
a
softer
line
in
light
of
the
new
political
reform
era
in
Indonesia
,
or
is
just
trying
to
sort
itself
out
after
Suharto
's
fall
and
the
deaths
of
12
senior
regional
military
commanders
in
a
helicopter
crash
this
month
.

The
United
States
suspended
most
of
its
military
assistance
to
Indonesia
after
the
1991
killings
in
Dili
,
but
nonetheless
East
Timor
hardly
registers
on
the
agenda
in
Jakarta
unless
foreign
governments
bring
up
the
issue
.

Analysts
say
the
next
few
weeks
should
indicate
how
far
the
student
movement
in
East
Timor
will
go
,
but
it
appears
from
today
's
demonstration
that
it
is
unlikely
the
protesters
will
try
to
march
in
the
streets
or
take
over
parliament
,
as
students
tried
to
do
in
Jakarta
.

Panic
almost
erupted
during
today
's
protest
when
a
truck
of
soldiers
merely
drove
by
.

The
demonstration
was
held
far
out
of
sight
of
the
main
road
to
lessen
the
chances
of
a
confrontation
.

The
climate
of
fear
in
East
Timor
goes
much
deeper
than
in
Indonesia
.

Nearly
every
other
adult
in
Dili
has
been
detained
or
tortured
,
or
knows
someone
who
has
been
,
during
the
past
23
years
of
Indonesian
rule
.

Reports
from
Lisbon
said
that
authorities
today
detained
prominent
activist
M
'
a
Huno
,
who
had
been
a
commander
of
separatist
forces
.

The
military
has
been
trying
to
root
out
elements
or
supporters
of
the
Fretilin
independence
movement
,
which
has
been
waging
an
armed
struggle
against
the
Indonesian
occupation
.

Scattered
pockets
of
resistance
remain
,
but
the
rebellion
has
lost
much
of
its
steam
.

Domingos
Maria
Alvez
,
67
,
was
one
of
East
Timor
's
first
resistance
fighters
and
in
the
1970s
was
detained
for
eight
months
,
tied
up
in
a
cave
part
of
the
time
.

Alvez
attended
today
's
demonstration
with
his
grandson
and
said
he
has
been
waiting
years
for
the
chance
to
speak
out
.

"
I
have
hope
when
I
see
these
young
people
now
,
"
he
said
.
"

When
I
see
them
struggling
,
it
gives
meaning
to
my
struggle
before
.

I
'm
already
old
,
but
my
dream
would
be
fulfilled
to
see
the
new
generation
liberated
from
the
oppressors
.

SEOUL
,
South
Korea
(
AP
)

North
Korea
has
told
American
lawmakers
it
already
has
nuclear
weapons
and
intends
to
build
more
,
a
senior
U.S.
congressman
said
Monday
after
returning
from
a
trip
to
the
communist
state
.

``
They
admitted
to
having
nuclear
capability
and
weapons
at
this
moment
,
''
said
Rep.
Curt
Weldon
,
who
headed
a
delegation
of
U.S.
lawmakers
that
visited
Pyongyang
for
three
days
ending
Sunday
.

``
They
admitted
to
an
effort
to
expand
their
nuclear
production
program
.
''

Weldon
's
comments
echoed
those
of
U.S.
officials
following
talks
in
Beijing
in
April
.

They
said
that
North
Korea
claimed
during
a
pause
in
the
formal
talks
that
it
already
had
nuclear
weapons
,
but
would
give
up
the
program
in
return
for
economic
aid
and
security
guarantees
.

Weldon
said
at
a
news
conference
in
Seoul
that
North
Korean
Vice
Foreign
Minister
Kim
Kye
Gwan
repeated
that
claim
during
a
dinner
meeting
.

Both
Kim
and
Foreign
Minister
Paek
Nam
Sun
told
Weldon
that
Pyongyang
planned
to
produce
more
nuclear
weapons
and
had
nearly
finished
reprocessing
the
spent
nuclear
fuel
rods
needed
to
do
so
,
despite
pressure
from
the
United
States
and
its
allies
.

``
They
admitted
to
having
just
about
completed
the
reprocessing
of
8,000
rods
,
''
said
Weldon
,
a
Republican
who
is
the
No.
2
member
of
a
U.S.
House
panel
that
oversees
the
armed
forces
.

U.S.
experts
say
that
reprocessing
the
rods
could
give
North
Korea
several
more
nuclear
bombs
within
months
.

During
their
visit
to
Pyongyang
,
Weldon
's
delegation
also
met
Choe
Thae
Bok
,
chairman
of
North
Korea
's
legislature
,
the
Supreme
People
's
Assembly
.

Although
they
were
not
traveling
as
envoys
of
U.S.
President
George
W.
Bush
,
they
were
the
first
American
officials
to
visit
since
the
nuclear
standoff
began
in
October
.

They
flew
to
Seoul
on
Sunday
to
brief
South
Korean
officials
on
their
Northern
trip
.

North
Korea
said
it
was
developing
its
nuclear
weapons
as
``
a
response
to
what
they
saw
happened
in
Iraq
,
with
the
U.S.
removing
Saddam
Hussein
from
power
,
''
Weldon
said
.

A
North
Korean
foreign
ministry
spokesman
was
quoted
as
saying
by
state-run
KCNA
news
agency
that
the
visit
helped
both
sides
better
understand
each
other
and
they
shared
the
view
that
Washington
and
Pyongyang
needed
to
avoid
confrontation
and
exist
peacefully
.

``
They
were
of
the
same
view
that
it
is
necessary
to
seek
a
negotiated
settlement
of
the
nuclear
issue
and
expressed
their
stand
that
it
is
necessary
to
continue
seeking
and
discussing
ways
of
settling
it
,
''
the
spokesman
said
.

North
Korea
has
repeatedly
accused
Washington
of
planing
to
invade
.

Bush
says
he
prefers
a
diplomatic
solution
,
but
has
not
ruled
out
a
military
option
.

In
Seoul
,
South
Korean
President
Roh
Moo-hyun
said
his
government
has
no
``
clear
proof
''
to
conclude
North
Korea
has
nuclear
weapons
.

``
North
Korea
has
told
important
people
of
the
United
States
that
it
has
developed
nukes
and
reprocessed
spent
fuel
rods
.

But
North
Korea
has
not
confirmed
that
to
anyone
else
,
''
Roh
said
.

``
Thus
,
we
must
make
a
very
careful
judgment
on
whether
we
will
conclude
it
has
nuclear
weapons
or
not
,
based
on
those
words
only
.
''

U.S.
and
South
Korean
officials
say
that
North
Korea
may
be
bluffing
about
its
nuclear
program
in
an
attempt
to
extract
concessions
from
the
United
States
.

But
U.S.
Deputy
Defense
Secretary
Paul
Wolfowitz
said
Monday
that
the
threat
could
n't
be
ignored
.

``
Certainly
what
we
know
suggests
that
we
should
take
what
they
(
North
Korean
officials
)
are
saying
very
seriously
,
''
he
said
at
a
news
conference
in
Seoul
.

Weldon
said
his
delegation
``
comes
away
convinced
''
that
the
nuclear
standoff
can
be
resolved
in
a
peaceful
manner
that
allows
Pyongyang
's
communist
regime
to
stand
while
removing
its
nuclear
threats
.

Roh
issued
a
similar
message
during
a
nationally
televised
news
conference
.

``
South
Korea
and
the
United
States
share
a
firm
principle
that
North
Korea
should
never
possess
nuclear
weapons
and
that
the
issue
should
be
resolved
through
a
peaceful
manner
,
''
he
said
.

Roh
spoke
after
meeting
the
U.S.
lawmakers
and
Wolfowitz
,
who
also
arrived
in
Seoul
on
Sunday
for
a
two-day
visit
to
discuss
North
Korea
.

Wolfowitz
said
Saturday
in
Singapore
that
Washington
hoped
putting
pressure
on
North
Korea
's
battered
economy
would
resolve
the
nuclear
standoff
.

On
Monday
,
Wolfowitz
stressed
that
military
readiness
was
just
as
important
.

In
meetings
with
South
Korean
officials
,
Wolfowitz
urged
them
to
increase
military
spending
on
new
technologies
and
telecommunications
equipment
,
as
U.S.
forces
have
done
.

South
Korea
earmarks
about
US$
14.5
billion
for
its
military
.

``
They
still
work
with
paper
and
pencil
instead
of
with
the
kind
of
modern
communications
gear
that
our
special
forces
took
with
them
to
Afghanistan
,
''
Wolfowitz
said
.

He
said
upgrades
would
allow
troops
to
react
quicker
to
threats
from
the
North
and
help
reduce
the
possibility
of
a
military
conflict
on
the
peninsula
,
not
heighten
it
.

The
nuclear
crisis
flared
last
October
when
U.S.
officials
said
North
Korea
admitted
running
a
secret
nuclear
weapons
program
in
violation
of
a
1994
accord
with
Washington
.

TALLAHASSEE
,
Fla.
_
The
Florida
Supreme
Court
rejected
an
appeal
Friday
by
Vice
President
Al
Gore
that
it
begin
the
immediate
manual
recount
of
14,000
disputed
ballots
from
South
Florida
,
forcing
Gore
's
contest
of
the
presidential
election
into
a
lower-court
trial
that
begins
Saturday
morning
.

An
hour
later
,
the
state
's
highest
court
dealt
another
blow
to
supporters
of
Gore
in
Palm
Beach
County
,
refusing
to
order
a
new
election
that
many
voters
said
was
necessary
because
of
the
confusing
nature
of
the
``
butterfly
''
ballot
.

The
day
in
Tallahassee
was
not
a
complete
loss
for
the
vice
president
's
camp
,
however
.

Judge
N.
Sanders
Sauls
of
Leon
County
Circuit
Court
,
who
is
presiding
over
the
contest
lawsuit
,
announced
what
could
be
a
relatively
brisk
pace
for
Saturday
's
trial
,
expressing
the
hope
that
it
could
be
concluded
in
one
marathon
12-hour
session
.

If
the
judge
should
agree
on
Saturday
to
Gore
's
demand
that
the
ballots
be
counted
,
the
Democratic
team
would
not
be
much
further
behind
schedule
than
if
the
Supreme
Court
had
agreed
to
the
appeal
.

Lawyers
for
Gov.
George
W.
Bush
have
vowed
to
use
every
argument
at
their
disposal
to
make
certain
that
no
ballots
are
counted
,
and
that
the
contest
lawsuit
is
dismissed
.

But
they
backed
away
Friday
from
some
earlier
plans
that
could
have
delayed
the
trial
,
including
a
demand
that
three
Florida
counties
send
1.17
million
ballots
to
Tallahassee
,
in
addition
to
the
1.16
million
ballots
from
Palm
Beach
and
Miami-Dade
counties
that
finished
arriving
here
Friday
.

Instead
,
the
Bush
lawyers
agreed
to
the
proposal
by
Sauls
that
the
ballots
in
Volusia
,
Broward
and
Pinellas
counties
simply
be
impounded
as
possible
evidence
where
they
are
,
and
not
be
transported
.

Bush
's
lawyers
also
said
they
would
not
insist
that
the
opening
of
the
trial
deal
with
a
series
of
new
issues
they
raised
in
a
brief
on
Thursday
night
.

Those
issues
include
whether
Gore
is
really
a
candidate
entitled
to
bring
a
contest
lawsuit
_
technically
,
only
the
electors
for
a
candidate
are
on
a
presidential
ballot
_
and
whether
any
presidential
election
can
truly
be
contested
under
Florida
law
.

The
Bush
team
also
agreed
to
call
no
more
than
20
witnesses
at
the
trial
,
not
the
93
named
in
a
witness
list
submitted
Thursday
night
.

Gore
's
lawyers
plan
to
call
two
witnesses
.

The
willingness
of
the
Bush
team
to
pare
down
its
demands
may
have
come
from
the
realization
that
Sauls
was
not
going
to
allow
any
obvious
delay
tactics
in
the
trial
.

The
judge
said
he
understood
why
Gore
needed
to
accelerate
the
process
;
if
the
trial
,
the
vote-counting
and
any
subsequent
appeals
extend
beyond
Dec.
12
,
the
Florida
Legislature
will
send
Bush
's
electors
to
the
Electoral
College
and
the
contest
lawsuit
will
likely
become
moot
.

At
a
preliminary
hearing
Friday
afternoon
,
Sauls
made
it
clear
he
would
take
a
no-nonsense
approach
to
the
trial
.

Lawyers
for
the
various
parties
to
the
suit
would
not
be
allowed
to
repeat
arguments
already
made
,
he
said
,
an
important
consideration
because
there
are
multiple
defendants
in
the
suit
:
Bush
;
Katherine
Harris
,
the
Florida
secretary
of
state
;
and
the
election
boards
of
three
counties
.

COPENHAGEN
,
Denmark
(
AP
)
_
A
Danish
couple
were
surprised
this
weekend
when
two
absentee
ballots
from
the
U.S.
presidential
election
turned
up
in
their
mail
.

Brian
Kain
,
a
33-year-old
accountant
and
sailing
enthusiast
,
eagerly
opened
a
large
envelope
when
it
arrived
Saturday
with
some
information
about
navigation
charts
that
he
had
ordered
from
a
company
based
in
the
state
of
Washington
.

He
assumed
two
extra
sealed
yellow
envelopes
inside
the
package
were
ads
and
planned
to
throw
them
away
until
his
wife
,
Helle
,
opened
one
of
them
to
discover
the
absentee
ballot
of
Steven
H.
Forrester
of
Bellevue
,
Wash.

``
The
most
interesting
thing
to
me
was
the
free
chart
and
the
brochure
,
''
said
Kain
.

The
Kains
did
n't
open
the
second
envelope
but
assumed
it
also
was
a
ballot
since
both
were
marked
with
the
words
``
Official
ballot
_
do
not
delay
.
''

They
contacted
the
U.S.
Embassy
in
Copenhagen
on
Monday
and
were
asked
to
put
the
envelopes
in
the
mail
.

Embassy
spokeswoman
Lela
Margiou
said
they
were
waiting
to
receive
the
ballots
and
had
not
yet
decided
what
to
do
with
them
.

``
It
's
kind
of
unusual
,
''
Margiou
said
,
adding
that
the
ballots
``
were
not
valid
,
were
not
meaningful
because
counting
in
Washington
State
has
been
completed
.
''

Kain
had
ordered
the
information
via
the
Internet
from
Tides
End
Ltd.
of
Washington
.

The
large
envelope
,
which
was
postmarked
from
Shaw
Island
,
arrived
unsealed
at
the
Kains
'
home
in
Odense
,
105
miles
west
of
the
capital
,
Copenhagen
.

The
Fyens
Stiftstidende
,
the
main
local
newspaper
,
said
it
contacted
Forrester
to
tell
him
his
ballot
had
landed
in
Denmark
and
he
did
not
understand
how
it
could
have
been
postmarked
in
Shaw
Island
,
50
miles
from
where
his
wife
mailed
it
in
Bellevue
.

Forrester
told
the
newspaper
he
had
no
plans
of
pursuing
the
matter
.

``
The
vote
is
,
I
think
,
over
,
''
he
was
quoted
as
saying
.

The
U.S.
presidential
race
between
Republican
nominee
Texas
Gov.
George
W.
Bush
and
Democratic
Vice
President
Al
Gore
remained
undecided
Monday
with
the
state
of
Florida
's
25
electoral
votes
still
at
stake

BUCHAREST
,
Romania
(

)
_
Outraged
at
the
spectacle
of
young
people
kissing
in
a
streetcar
named
for
a
13th
century
crusader
against
pagan
sleaze
,
the
Greek
Catholic
Church
asked
the
government
Thursday
to
quash
Valentine
's
Day
celebrations
.

``
From
a
Christian
point
of
view
,
this
is
a
profanation
of
a
martyr
of
virtue
and
chastity
,
''
Tertulian
Langa
,
a
Greek
Catholic
priest
,
told
the
AP
by
telephone
.

``
His
name
has
been
turned
into
a
public
orgy
.
''

Langa
was
referring
to
a
Feb.
14
stunt
in
a
streetcar
dubbed
Valentine
,
in
which
a
justice
of
the
peace
married
20
young
couples
for
the
day
.

The
event
attracted
a
lot
of
media
attention
and
helped
popularize
the
holiday
,
recently
introduced
to
formerly
communist
Romania
.

``
This
streetcar
has
no
sacred
character
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
Holiness
.

We
are
insulted
,
''
said
Langa
from
the
Greek
Catholic
headquarters
,
some
325
kilometers
(
203
miles
)
northwest
of
Bucharest
.

Langan
said
he
had
sent
letters
to
five
government
ministries
,
requesting
they
``
undertake
the
necessary
action
to
combat
this
degradation
of
public
life
.
''

In
a
different
protest
of
the
holiday
,
the
mayor
of
Cluj
,
Gheorghe
Funar
,
refused
a
Valentine
's
Day
gift
of
flowers
,
claiming
such
an
act
symbolized
``
false
capitalist
values
.
''

St.
Valentine
was
a
Roman
priest
and
martyr
who
fought
against
pagan
love
fests
.

He
was
killed
in
Rome
in
270
.

In
the
past
couple
of
years
,
Romanians
have
begun
exchanging
bunches
of
flowers
and
small
gifts
on
Feb.
14
,
calling
it
``
Lovers
'
Day
.

Police
intercepted
33
African
immigrants
who
came
ashore
Thursday
in
southern
Spain
aboard
an
overcrowded
boat
,
including
several
pregnant
women
and
other
travelers
suffering
from
hypothermia
,
police
said
.

Spanish
media
showed
dramatic
photos
of
police
struggling
to
carry
women
on
the
verge
of
fainting
after
they
were
found
wandering
through
Tarifa
,
Spain
's
windswept
southern
tip
,
Civil
Guard
officials
told
Spanish
news
agencies
.

Police
also
arrested
two
Moroccan
men
suspected
of
trafficking
in
human
beings
and
navigating
the
Zodiac
boat
across
from
Africa
,
Efe
said
.

Twenty-six
of
the
would-be
immigrants
were
from
sub-Saharan
Africa
,
six
of
them
women
,
and
the
other
seven
were
males
from
North
African
countries
,
police
said

Red
Cross
officials
administered
first
aid
on
the
scene
,
and
the
detainees
were
taken
to
a

by
crossing
the

Strait
of
Gibraltar
to
reach
the
southern

northwest
to
the
Canary
Islands
out
in

BELFAST
,
Britain
,
April
8
(
Xinhua
)

A
two-day
summit
between
British
Prime
Minister
Tony
Blair
and
US
President
George
W.
Bush
ended
here
Tuesday
with
both
countries
trying
to
minimize
splits
on
UN
role
in
rebuilding
Iraq
after
the
ongoing
US
-
led
war
against
the
country
is
over
.

As
the
US
-
led
coalition
troops
are
reportedly
thrusting
into
Baghdad
and
the
second
Iraqi
city
of
Basra
,
Blair
and
Bush
agreed
there
would
be
a
"
vital
role
"
for
the
United
Nations
in
post-war
Iraq
.

During
their
first
war
summit
on
March
27
at
Camp
David
,
Blair
and
Bush
became
divided
over
what
a
role
the
United
Nations
will
play
in
postwar
Iraq
,
when
Bush
gave
no
positive
reaction
to
Blair
's
suggestion
of
a
strong
UN
role
.

After
the
Camp
David
talks
,
Blair
,
who
analysts
say
has
been
pursuing
a
special
relationship
with
Washington
in
order
to
restore
Britain
's
traditional
role
as
a
transatlantic
"
bridge
"
,
was
forced
to
readjust
his
tone
.

Blair
and
Bush
were
expected
to
bridge
their
gap
on
the
issue
by
reaching
an
agreement
on
UN
role
in
post-war
Iraq
,
some
analysts
said
even
before
this
summit
at
Hillsborough
,
south
of
Belfast
,
the
second
of
its
kind
since
the
war
broke
out
on
March
20
.

In
a
joint
written
statement
,
the
two
allies
pledged
to
seek
UN
Security
Council
resolutions
to
affirm
Iraq
's
territorial
integrity
,
ensure
aid
delivery
and
endorse
an
"
appropriate
"
post
-
conflict
administration
for
Iraq
.

"
We
welcome
the
appointment
by
the
United
Nations
Secretary
-
General
of
a
special
adviser
for
Iraq
to
work
with
the
people
of
Iraq
and
coalition
representatives
,
"
the
statement
added
.

The
United
Nations
would
have
a
"
vital
role
"
in
the
effort
to
repair
Iraq
's
infrastructure
,
Blair
told
reporters
at
a
news
conference
after
his
talks
with
Bush
,
downplaying
UN
role
in
emphasizing
that
ultimately
the
country
must
be
run
by
the
Iraqi
people
.

"
The
key
is
that
Iraq
in
the
end
should
be
governed
by
the
Iraqi
people
,
"
Blair
said
,
pledging
that
British
and
US
forces
would
not
stay
in
the
country
"
a
day
longer
than
necessary
"
.

It
was
a
"
false
choice
"
to
debate
whether
Iraq
should
be
run
by
coalition
forces
or
the
United
Nations
,
said
Blair
,
who
was
believed
to
be
in
favor
of
a
stronger
UN
role
in
post-conflict
Iraq
than
Bush
.

Echoing
Blair
,
Bush
said
the
UN
would
play
a
role
in
all
aspects
of
post-war
Iraq
,
from
humanitarian
aid
to
a
future
interim
authority
,
adding
that
Iraq
would
"
move
as
quickly
as
possible
"
to
an
interim
authority
made
up
of
Iraqis
from
inside
and
outside
the
country
.

However
,
when
pressed
on
what
precisely
the
UN
role
would
be
,
Bush
on
Tuesday
mentioned
only
humanitarian
work
,
"
suggesting
"
people
to
staff
the
interim
authority
and
helping
Iraq
"
progress
.
"

"
When
we
say
vital
role
for
the
United
Nations
,
we
mean
vital
role
for
the
United
Nations
in
all
aspects
of
the
issue
,
whether
it
be
humanitarian
aid
,
or
whether
it
be
helping
to
stand
up
an
interim
authority
.

The
Iraqi
people
will
decide
who
's
on
the
Iraqi
interim
authority
,
"
said
Bush
.

Bush
did
not
spell
out
how
much
power
the
United
Nations
would
have
,
nor
did
he
elaborate
on
Washington
's
plans
to
place
US
officials
alongside
Iraqis
in
the
interim
administration
.

Differences
still
remain
between
the
United
States
and
Britain
,
analysts
said
,
over
the
speed
with
which
Iraq
should
be
handed
to
an
interim
Iraqi
administration
,
and
the
extent
to
which
a
US
-
led
group
of
generals
and
former
diplomats
should
effectively
run
the
country
.

Yet
,
analysts
argued
,
both
Britain
and
the
United
States
hope
their
agreed
vision
of
a
postwar
scenario
will
placate
anti-war
nations
such
as
France
,
Germany
and
Russia
.

"
We
will
move
as
quickly
as
possible
to
place
governmental
responsibilities
under
the
control
of
an
interim
authority
composed
of
Iraqis
from
both
inside
and
outside
the
country
,
"
Bush
vowed
at
the
joint
news
conference
with
Blair
,
adding
that
the
interim
authority
would
serve
until
a
permanent
government
could
be
chosen
by
the
Iraqi
people
.

"
Rebuilding
of
Iraq
will
require
the
support
and
expertise
of
the
international
community
.

We
are
committed
to
working
with
international
institutions
,
including
the
United
Nations
,
which
will
have
a
vital
role
to
play
in
this
task
,
"
Bush
added
.

Blair
also
pleaded
the
world
to
avoid
"
endless
diplomatic
wrangles
"
over
the
future
of
Iraq
like
the
international
dispute
over
a
second
UN
resolution
on
Iraq
that
preceded
the
war
.

France
and
Germany
,
which
were
most
vocal
in
opposing
this
US
-
led
war
against
Iraq
,
have
been
insisting
that
the
United
Nations
should
play
a
central
role
in
the
phase
of
post-war
Iraq
.

On
the
unresolved
dispute
between
Europe
and
the
United
States
,
analysts
say
,
Blair
might
again
have
to
make
a
difficult
choice
,
but
he
is
very
likely
to
support
the
United
States
,
which
Britain
can
not
afford
to
fall
out
with
.

WASHINGTON
(
AP
)
_
Herbert
Lawrence
Block
is
not
subtle
.

But
then
subtlety
is
not
a
trait
of
political
cartoonists
,
a
trade
that
Block
_
better
known
as
Herblock
_
has
plied
for
the
past
71
years
.

From
his
base
on
The
Washington
Post
's
editorial
page
,
Herblock
has
sprayed
ink
on
big
issues
and
big
shots
,
from
Vietnam
to
Watergate
and
the
Soviet
bear
,
from
presidents
Truman
to
Nixon
and
Clinton
.

``
You
see
a
cartoon
in
the
newspapers
and
it
goes
`
Boom
!

Bang
!
''
'

Herblock
,
who
turned
91
on
Friday
,
once
told
a
reporter
.

Tuesday
,
a
retrospective
of
his
work
goes
on
display
at
the
Library
of
Congress
.

Lately
,
his
shrapnel
has
stung
Slobodan
Milosevic
,
Yasser
Arafat
,
the
National
Rifle
Association
and
others
.

Al
Gore
and
George
W.
Bush
have
taken
fire
,
and
whoever
wins
in
November
will
take
more
.

They
can
ask
Clinton
.

Few
Herblock
targets
,
however
,
were
as
favored
as
Nixon
,
drawn
with
deep-set
,
malevolent
eyes
,
five
o'clock
shadow
and
,
when
he
was
vice
president
in
Eisenhower
's
administration
,
with
a
bloodstained
hatchet
in
hand
.

But
Herblock
offered
a
truce
when
Nixon
was
elected
president
in
1968
.

He
gave
Nixon
a
shave
.

``
I
gave
him
a
chance
,
but
after
a
while
people
saw
he
was
the
same
old
Nixon
,
''
Herblock
said
in
an
interview
Monday
.

Herblock
also
was
an
unrelenting
opponent
of
Sen.
Joe
McCarthy
,
and
the
artist
coined
the
term
McCarthyism
.

For
a
March
29
,
1950
,
cartoon
he
drew
four
Republican
stalwarts
hauling
a
reluctant
GOP
elephant
toward
a
teetering
stack
of
tar
buckets
,
topped
by
a
dripping
barrel
labeled
``
McCarthyism
''
and
a
little
platform
above
that
.

He
and
the
library
agree
that
was
the
origin
of
the
word
_
``
with
no
thought
of
creating
a
new
term
,
''
Herblock
wrote
later
.

In
the
caption
,
the
elephant
says
:
``
You
mean
I
'm
supposed
to
stand
on
that
?
''

Still
,
McCarthy
,
Herblock
noted
,
even
adopted
the
term
as
a
title
for
a
book
``
McCarthyism
:
The
Fight
for
America
.
''

Every
president
has
had
his
turn
under
Herblock
's
pen
.

Other
subjects
include
U.S.
intervention
in
Vietnam
,
Soviet
and
Chinese
oppression
,
nuclear
weapons
,
curtailed
voting
rights
for
the
District
of
Columbia
,
slum
housing
,
campaign
fund
raising
,
drunk
drivers
and
racism
.

He
apparently
has
no
intention
of
retiring
any
time
soon
from
the
Post
,
where
he
has
toiled
for
54
years
.

At
a
reception
Monday
,
James
H.
Billington
,
the
librarian
of
Congress
,
said
Herblock
's
cartoons
will
be
seen
100
years
from
now
.

To
that
,
the
artist
said
:
``
Yes
,
and
I
hope
they
will
be
saying
'
That
was
a
good
one
this
morning
.
''
'

Jean
Rickard
,
Herblock
's
assistant
for
43
years
,
said
the
cartoonist
goes
to
the
office
daily
to
keep
close
to
the
news
and
check
his
facts
.

``
I
was
just
about
to
turn
in
a
finished
cartoon
one
day
,
''
Herblock
writes
in
the
catalog
to
the
show
,
``
only
to
learn
that
a
major
story
had
broken
and
kept
the
newsroom
people
too
busy
to
tell
me
about
it
.

The
quick
return
to
the
drawing
board
to
produce
a
new
cartoon
in
minutes
was
an
experience
I
would
n't
want
to
repeat
.
''

Born
and
raised
in
Chicago
,
Herblock
's
first
full-time
cartoonist
's
job
was
on
the
Chicago
Daily
News
.

His
father
,
a
chemist
and
contributor
to
humor
magazines
,
suggested
joining
the
first
and
last
syllables
of
his
name
.

His
first
cartoon
for
the
News
_
April
24
,
1929
_
blasted
the
timber
industry
.

It
was
a
bleak
view
of
rough-cut
tree
stumps
stretching
to
the
horizon
,
with
an
ironic
quote
from
the
poet
Henry
Wadsworth
Longfellow
:
``
This
is
the
forest
primeval
.
''

Since
then
Herblock
has
published
a
dozen
books
,
won
three
Pulitzer
Prizes
and
shared
in
a
fourth
.

In
just
two
weeks
this
month
,
as
investors
worried
whether
the
violence
in
the
Middle
East
would
escalate
into
war
,
the
stock
market
in
Israel
fell
16
percent
.

In
Egypt
,
the
market
dropped
20
percent
.

But
for
most
American
investors
,
many
of
whom
buy
their
stocks
through
mutual
funds
,
the
impact
was
more
diffuse
,
though
still
strong
.

While
few
investors
own
funds
containing
many
Middle
Eastern
companies
,
partly
because
there
are
not
that
many
around
to
buy
,
they
nonetheless
felt
the
effects
of
the
region
's
volatility
.

Wall
Street
and
other
global
markets
were
concerned
that
the
violence
would
translate
into
higher
oil
prices
_
which
it
did
,
briefly
_
and
that
those
prices
,
in
turn
,
could
lead
to
inflation
and
higher
interest
rates
.

That
line
of
thinking
played
a
big
role
in
the
379-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
industrial
average
and
the
93-point
drop
in
the
Nasdaq
composite
index
on
Oct.
12
_
the
day
that
a
Palestinian
mob
mauled
two
Israeli
soldiers
,
Israel
retaliated
with
rocket
attacks
and
terrorists
blew
a
hole
in
a
United
States
warship
in
Yemen
.

Last
week
,
Israeli
and
Palestinian
leaders
agreed
to
the
terms
of
a
cease-fire
after
clashes
in
the
West
Bank
and
the
Gaza
Strip
.

``
For
American
investors
,
the
oil
effect
was
much
more
significant
than
the
direct
effect
on
Middle
East
companies
,
''
said
Grace
Pineda
,
who
manages
the
$
132
million
Developing
Capital
Markets
fund
for
Merrill
Lynch
.

The
fund
has
about
5
percent
of
its
money
in
Israel
and
about
0.5
percent
in
Egypt
.

From
late
September
,
when
the
latest
trouble
erupted
in
the
Middle
East
,
through
last
week
,
the
broad
markets
and
several
categories
of
mutual
funds
lost
ground
in
the
United
States
.

In
the
most
violent
period
,
Oct.
5
through
12
,
equity
income
funds
were
down
4.80
percent
,
according
to
Lipper
Inc.
Growth
funds
were
off
7.79
percent
,
and
growth-and-income
funds
6.12
percent
.

Those
funds
generally
do
not
contain
shares
of
Middle
Eastern
companies
,
yet
the
trouble
in
the
region
was
among
several
factors
_
along
with
a
general
sell-off
in
technology
and
telecommunications
stocks
_
that
brought
down
prices
.

Emerging-markets
funds
declined
7.17
percent
over
that
period
.

Although
many
of
those
funds
invest
in
Middle
Eastern
companies
,
the
ripple
effect
of
the
threat
to
oil
affected
them
most
,
analysts
and
fund
managers
said
.

And
those
funds
'
investments
in
the
region
are
still
relatively
small
,
usually
less
than
10
percent
of
the
portfolios
.

``
Most
of
the
markets
in
the
Middle
East
are
insignificant
in
terms
of
the
amount
of
capital
invested
in
them
from
the
United
States
,
''
said
Mark
Madden
,
manager
of
the
$
250
million
Pioneer
Emerging
Markets
fund
.
''

Madden
invests
mainly
in
Mexico
,
Brazil
and
Korea
.

About
5
percent
of
his
portfolio
is
in
Israel
and
less
than
1
percent
is
in
Egypt
.

Except
during
such
tense
times
in
the
Middle
East
,
analysts
and
fund
managers
said
,
fluctuations
in
the
United
States
markets
,
the
biggest
and
most
dynamic
in
the
world
,
are
more
likely
to
influence
share
prices
in
the
Middle
East
than
vice
versa
.

``
The
first
thing
overseas
traders
want
to
know
when
they
come
in
in
the
morning
is
,
`
What
did
the
Nasdaq
and
the
Dow
do
?
''
'

said
Howard
Klein
,
an
institutional
broker
specializing
in
emerging
markets
at
SG
Cowen
Securities
in
New
York
.

Traders
in
Israel
in
particular
have
their
eyes
on
the
Nasdaq
.

Their
country
is
also
home
to
global
technology
,
telecommunications
and
pharmaceutical
companies
,
which
depend
on
economic
currents
in
the
United
States
and
Europe
much
more
than
on
developments
in
the
Middle
East
.

Shares
of
many
Israeli
companies
are
sold
as
American
Depository
Receipts
on
the
Nasdaq
.

Only
a
handful
of
small
funds
concentrate
on
the
Middle
East
.

One
of
them
,
the
$
25
million
American
Israel
Index
mutual
fund
,
is
made
up
exclusively
of
Israeli
companies
,
16
traded
on
the
Tel
Aviv
exchange
and
19
on
the
Nasdaq
.

Like
more
broadly
based
mutual
funds
,
its
shares
fell
during
the
recent
turmoil
.

But
its
investors
remained
confident
.

In
the
last
few
weeks
,
money
flowing
into
the
fund
far
exceeded
redemptions
.

Almost
a
month
after
rejecting
PepsiCo
's
takeover
offer
as
too
low
,
Quaker
Oats
Co.
is
now
close
to
reaching
the
same
deal
,
to
be
acquired
by
PepsiCo
for
$
13.7
billion
,
say
executives
close
to
the
negotiations
.

The
resumption
of
the
talks
follows
a
decision
by
Coca-Cola
's
board
last
week
to
abandon
its
own
$
16
billion
deal
to
buy
Quaker
Oats
and
its
prize
growth
brand
,
Gatorade
.

That
deal
was
scuttled
at
the
11th
hour
when
a
divided
Coke
board
decided
it
would
be
paying
too
much
for
Quaker
,
the
maker
of
food
products
such
as
Rice-A-Roni
,
Aunt
Jemima
and
Cap'n
Crunch
.

The
boards
of
Pepsi
and
Quaker
Oats
are
expected
to
meet
separately
over
the
weekend
to
decide
whether
to
proceed
with
the
deal
,
the
executives
said
.

A
takeover
could
be
announced
as
early
as
Monday
,
the
executives
added
.

Because
two
sets
of
takeover
negotiations
have
already
fallen
apart
,
one
executive
said
that
the
deal
was
not
yet
certain
and
could
collapse
.

Neither
Pepsi
nor
Quaker
would
comment
.

According
to
the
executives
,
PepsiCo
has
offered
to
pay
Quaker
shareholders
the
same
2.3
PepsiCo
shares
_
or
$
104.65
a
share
_
it
offered
before
for
every
share
of
Quaker
.

That
represents
a
premium
of
20
percent
over
Quaker
's
stock
price
,
which
closed
Thursday
at
$
86.94
,
down
69
cents
.

Shares
of
PepsiCo
rose
13
cents
Thursday
,
to
$
45.50
.

Based
on
Thursday
's
stock
price
,
the
deal
would
be
worth
about
the
same
as
Pepsi
's
original
bid
.

If
Pepsi
and
Quaker
come
to
an
agreement
,
the
deal
would
end
a
monthlong
takeover
drama
that
included
public
and
private
machinations
by
PepsiCo
and
by
Coke
,
as
well
as
by
a
third
suitor
,
the
Danone
Group
of
France
,
for
control
of
Quaker
.

For
all
three
companies
,
Quaker
represents
a
chance
to
own
the
Gatorade
sports
drink
brand
,
which
has
proven
itself
to
be
a
growth
machine
in
an
industry
that
has
remained
relatively
stagnant
,
especially
the
once-celebrated
carbonated
drink
brands
.

If
the
deal
proceeds
,
PepsiCo
would
gain
a
commanding
stake
in
the
noncarbonated
beverage
industry
,
a
fast-growing
frontier
that
soft
drink
makers
have
traditionally
been
slow
to
explore
but
have
been
forced
to
take
seriously
in
recent
years
.

PepsiCo
's
return
to
the
bargaining
table
with
Quaker
Oats
had
been
greatly
anticipated
by
investors
and
analysts
,
especially
after
Coke
abandoned
its
deal
and
Danone
publicly
expressed
its
interest
in
buying
Quaker
and
then
reversed
its
position
the
next
day
.

PepsiCo
would
also
be
saddled
with
Quaker
's
food
business
,
which
it
would
probably
sell
,
the
executives
said
,
though
certain
brands
might
be
folded
into
PepsiCo
's
Frito-Lay
snacks
unit
.

Because
the
deal
would
be
structured
as
a
pooling
of
interests
,
the
executives
said
,
PepsiCo
would
not
be
able
to
sell
any
of
the
food
businesses
for
two
years
from
the
official
completion
of
the
transaction
.

The
acquisition
could
be
considered
a
major
blow
to
Coke
because
it
would
make
PepsiCo
,
the
smaller
of
the
two
,
a
much
more
powerful
rival
by
adding
$
1.8
billion
in
sales
to
PepsiCo
's
balance
sheet
.

PepsiCo
hopes
to
increase
sales
even
more
by
using
its
extensive
worldwide
bottling
and
distribution
business
to
make
Gatorade
a
global
brand
.

Nonetheless
,
some
analysts
have
questioned
whether
Gatorade
will
be
as
popular
in
Europe
and
Asia
as
it
has
been
in
the
United
States
,
one
of
the
reasons
Coke
backed
away
from
buying
Quaker
.

However
,
at
$
13.7
billion
,
most
analysts
agree
that
the
price
is
a
fair
one
.

Securing
Gatorade
would
round
out
Pepsi
's
lineup
of
some
of
the
best-performing
noncarbonated
brands
.

It
already
has
the
leading
position
in
the
iced
tea
market
with
its
Lipton
Brisk
,
as
well
as
the
dominant
stance
in
the
relatively
new
iced
coffee
segment
with
its
Starbucks
Frapuccino
line
.

Even
more
significantly
,
its
Aquafina
brand
of
bottled
water
,
a
category
responsible
for
roughly
half
of
all
the
growth
in
the
noncarbonated
soft
drink
business
,
is
the
industry
leader
,
squarely
edging
out
Coke
's
offering
in
the
field
,
Dasani
,
which
is
in
eighth
place
.

``
Pepsi
has
already
begun
to
move
very
aggressively
in
the
noncarbonated
area
,
''
said
John
Sicher
,
editor
of
Beverage
Digest
,
an
industry
newsletter
.

``
The
addition
of
Gatorade
would
be
a
huge
enhancement
to
that
strategy
.

NEW
YORK
,
April
7
-
NEW
YORK
,
April
7

Two
more
multibillion-dollar
deals
by
financial
firms
were
announced
today
,
bolstering
Wall
Street
's
conviction
that
this
week
's
marriage
of
Citicorp
and
Travelers
Group
signals
a
new
bout
of
merger
mania
.

Household
International
Inc.
,
one
of
the
nation
's
largest
consumer
lenders
,
agreed
to
buy
Beneficial
Corp.
,
another
giant
consumer
finance
company
,
in
an
$
8.6
billion
deal
.

And
Conseco
Inc.
,
a
life
and
health
insurer
,
agreed
to
buy
Green
Tree
Financial
Corp.
in
a
$
7.6
billion
arrangement
.

Despite
the
financial
deals
,
the
overall
stock
market
retreated
from
the
record
high
set
by
blue-chip
stocks
on
Monday
.

The
Dow
Jones
industrial
average
declined
76.73
points
,
or
0.85
percent
,
to
8956.50
,
just
one
day
after
it
closed
above
9000
for
the
first
time
ever
.

The
Standard
and
Poor
's
500-stock
index
fell
11.83
points
,
or
1.1
percent
,
to
1109.55
.

The
steepest
drop
came
in
the
Nasdaq
composite
index
,
which
tumbled
30.43
points
,
or
1.7
percent
,
to
1798.71
.

Money
managers
and
analysts
attributed
part
of
the
drop
to
fears
that
corporate
profits
are
slowing
,
triggered
by
Motorola
Inc.
's
warning
that
its
sales
have
been
hurt
by
Asia
's
economic
troubles
and
competition
from
European
rivals
.

Some
investors
also
are
skeptical
about
the
plan
to
merge
Citicorp
and
Travelers
.

Both
stocks
declined
today
after
big
gains
Monday
,
with
Citicorp
falling
15 3/8
,
to
165 1/8
,
and
Travelers
declining
4 5/8
,
to
68 3/8
.

Other
financial
shares
also
dropped
,
including
J.P.
Morgan
,
which
fell
4-11/16
,
to
139-15/16
.

Although
today
's
mergers
are
only
a
fraction
of
the
size
of
the
$
82
billion
Citicorp
-
Travelers
deal
,
they
reflect
the
same
strategic
imperative
to
grow
in
size
and
efficiency
or
lose
out
in
the
fast-changing
financial
services
industry
.

Officials
at
Household
International
and
Beneficial
said
in
a
statement
that
their
combination
will
"
have
the
financial
strength
,
portfolio
balance
and
expanded
market
presence
that
will
allow
us
to
provide
superior
returns
for
shareholders
.
"

"
Our
employees
and
customers
will
also
benefit
,
"
the
statement
said
.

Conseco
and
Green
Tree
officials
said
their
agreement
will
ultimately
help
secure
the
"
Middle
America
consumer
franchise
"
by
offering
a
wider
range
of
insurance
and
financial
services
to
11
million
middle-class
customers
around
the
country
.

"
The
financial
services
industry
is
converging
rapidly
,
as
recent
events
make
abundantly
clear
,
"
said
Stephen
C.
Hilbert
,
Conseco
's
president
and
chief
executive
.
"

Traditional
categories
,
and
traditional
companies
,
are
disappearing
.
"

Analysts
agreed
,
saying
the
new
combinations
add
to
the
pressure
to
consolidate
and
grow
larger
.

"
This
is
the
view
in
the
industry
,
that
you
must
be
of
a
certain
size
to
remain
competitive
. . . .
'
Bigger
is
better
.

Bigger
is
more
efficient
.

You
must
be
big
to
survive
,
'
"
said
Kathryn
H.
Bissette
,
a
financial
industry
analyst
with
Sterne
,
Agee
&
Leach
in
Atlanta
.
"

The
idea
of
consolidation
is
well
underway
.
"

Among
the
likely
candidates
for
future
deals
are
Chase
Manhattan
Bank
and
Merrill
Lynch
,
which
have
been
the
subject
of
rumors
for
months
.

Analysts
also
cited
J.P.
Morgan
,
PaineWebber
and
Morgan
Stanley
,
Dean
Witter
as
companies
that
likely
felt
more
vulnerable
after
the
announcement
by
Citicorp
and
Travelers
.

"
That
deal
changed
the
definition
of
'
large
,
'
"
said
David
Hochstim
,
an
equity
analyst
at
Bear
,
Stearns
.

Hochstim
said
he
expects
more
consolidations
.

"
This
merger
suggests
that
almost
anything
can
be
acquired
or
merged
. . . .
We
've
had
three
pretty
significant
deals
in
the
last
two
days
.

What
's
next

Four

SARAJEVO
,
Bosnia-Herzegovina
(
AP
)
_
Ending
months
of
uncertainty
,
the
Muslim
chairman
of
Bosnia
's
joint
presidency
announced
Friday
that
he
would
campaign
again
for
president
.

By
doing
so
,
Alija
Izetbegovic
,
73
,
missed
his
chance
to
become
the
first
leader
from
former
Yugoslavia
to
give
up
his
presidential
position
.

In
all
five
republics
that
became
countries
,
national
leaders
who
took
over
the
posts
between
1989
and
1991
and
participated
in
the
division
of
Yugoslavia
are
still
in
power
.

``
Balkan
leaders
do
n't
want
to
step
down
from
power
,
''
Izetbegovic
jokingly
told
a
press
conference
.

For
months
,
Izetbegovic
signaled
that
he
intended
to
withdraw
from
state
politics
and
concentrate
on
serving
as
president
of
the
ruling
Muslim
Party
of
Democratic
Action
,
or
SDA
.

He
cited
health
problems
and
old
age
as
reasons
why
he
wanted
to
step
aside
.

Izetbegovic
said
he
was
sure
he
would
pull
out
of
public
life
until
late
Thursday
,
when
68
out
of
88
party
leaders
demanded
that
he
become
a
candidate
for
Bosnia
's
three-member
presidency
.

At
Friday
's
press
conference
,
Izetbegovic
indicated
he
did
n't
expect
to
survive
a
four-year
term
as
a
member
of
the
presidency
.

He
suffered
a
second
heart
attack
in
February
1996
and
was
told
by
doctors
he
should
n't
work
any
more
.

Izetbegovic
is
expected
to
win
most
of
the
Muslim
votes
and
remain
in
the
joint
presidency
after
September
general
elections
.

But
many
opposition
leaders
,
independent
analysts
and
experts
foresee
the
Muslim
SDA
party
_
with
or
without
Izetbegovic
_
to
follow
the
trend
of
the
ruling
Bosnian
Croat
and
Serb
parties
.

The
hard-line
Bosnian
Serb
party
already
has
lost
its
absolute
majority
and
monopoly
over
the
votes
of
most
Bosnian
Serbs
in
the
country
,
while
the
same
fate
is
expected
for
the
ruling
Bosnian
Croat
party
after
a
recent
leadership
split
.

LOS
ANGELES
(
AP
)
_
The
Dick
Cheney
-
Joe
Lieberman
debate
was
praised
by
some
TV
commentators
as
an
exercise
in
good
manners
and
condemned
by
others
as
bad
politics
.

``
Highly
civilized
,
in
many
ways
they
articulated
the
positions
of
their
campaigns
more
effectively
than
the
top
of
their
ticket
when
they
met
in
Boston
,
''
Tom
Brokaw
said
.

``
Give
it
a
rave
,
''
said
CBS
anchor
Dan
Rather
.

This
will
go
down
as
the
best
vice
presidential
joint
appearance
on
television
since
the
television
era
in
presidential
and
vice
presidential
campaigns
began
.
''

His
colleague
,
Bob
Schieffer
,
wondered
whether
their
``
bosses
,
''
George
W.
Bush
and
Al
Gore
,
were
watching
.

Instant
polls
and
in-studio
audiences
also
gave
the
vice
presidential
candidates
high
marks
.

But
some
observers
pronounced
themselves
frustrated
by
the
debate
.

Fox
News
Channel
's
Mort
Kondracke
called
it
``
an
opportunity
wasted
by
Cheney
to
go
after
Gore
.
''

``
Maybe
somebody
could
have
given
the
candidates
a
hot
foot
or
put
a
joy
buzzer
on
their
seat
,
''
said
his
colleague
,
Fred
Barnes
.

Conservative
commentator
Bill
Kristol
,
also
on
FNC
,
said
``
the
Bush
campaign
failed
to
do
what
it
had
to
do
...
which
to
assault
al
Gore
's
policies
and
his
credibility
.
''

ABC
's
Sam
Donaldson
asked
plaintively
when
it
was
decreed
that
campaigners
had
to
act
like
``
gentlemen
and
ladies
.
''

``
I
think
that
's
nonsense
,
''
Donaldson
said
.

The
night
was
put
in
perspective
.

ABC
anchorman
Peter
Jennings
,
who
noted
that
``
bottom
of
the
ticket
''
does
n't
necessarily
have
that
much
affect
on
voter
decisions
.

NBC
's
Tim
Russert
of
predicted
the
veep
debate
's
``
effect
on
the
election
will
practically
be
nonexistent
.
''

A
group
of
undecided
voters
recruited
by
NBC
in
Tampa
,
Fla.
,
were
impressed
with
both
candidates
_
and
,
with
a
non-show
of
hands
,
all
indicated
they
remained
on
the
fence
.

On
Tuesday
,
an
estimated
46.5
million
people
watched
the
first
presidential
debate
between
Gore
and
Bush
,
which
some
commentators
deemed
rancorous
.

Lieberman
and
Cheney
were
probably
on
their
best
behavior
because
focus
groups
told
the
campaigns
that
conflict
does
n't
pay
,
commentators
mused
.

That
Gore
-
Bush
audience
was
comparable
to
the
46.1
million
people
who
watched
the
first
duel
between
President
Clinton
and
Bob
Dole
four
years
ago
,
but
fell
short
of
the
all-time
record
:
80
million
people
watched
President
Carter
and
Ronald
Reagan
square
off
in
1980
.

Cheney
and
Lieberman
,
with
moderator
Bernie
Shaw
,
met
at
Centre
College
in
Danville
,
Ky.
,
for
their
only
debate
.

Bush
and
Gore
have
two
more
debates
scheduled
,
on
Oct.
11
and
17
.

Some
Reshuffling
In
Sports
Marketing
There
were
two
developments
Wednesday
involving
sports
marketing
.

The
Octagon
sports
marketing
unit
of
the
Interpublic
Group
of
Cos.
named
Frank
Craighill
to
the
new
position
of
president
.

Craighill
,
58
,
who
has
been
co-chairman
of
the
Advantage
International
division
of
Octagon
in
Washington
,
will
remain
based
there
and
also
divide
his
time
between
Octagon
's
London
and
New
York
offices
.

Craighill
will
report
to
Frank
Lowe
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
of
Octagon
and
chairman
and
chief
executive
of
another
Interpublic
unit
,
Lowe
Group
.

At
Advantage
,
the
other
co-chairman
,
Lee
Fentress
,
56
,
will
become
the
sole
chairman
.

The
appointment
of
Craighill
came
days
after
Octagon
acquired
CSI
,
a
London
company
that
specializes
in
selling
and
distributing
sports
TV
rights
.

Terms
were
not
disclosed
.

CSI
has
90
employees
in
London
,
Amsterdam
,
Hong
Kong
,
New
York
and
Sydney
.

Michael
Watt
,
57
,
chairman
of
CSI
,
continues
in
that
role
.

And
the
Starcom
Media
Services
division
of
the
Leo
Burnett
Co.
in
Chicago
formed
a
unit
named
Starcom
Sports
Marketing
.

Wally
Hayward
,
29
,
and
Bruce
Blair
,
47
,
were
named
to
head
the
unit
as
sports
marketing
director
and
sports
media
director
,
respectively
.

Hayward
had
been
a
supervisor
for
sports
and
event
marketing
at
Burnett
.

Blair
had
held
a
similar
position
at
Starcom
Media
.

BANDA
ACEH
,
Indonesia
(
AP
)
_
Police
searched
for
separatist
activists
in
Indonesia
's
war-torn
Aceh
province
Sunday
after
tens
of
thousands
of
people
rallied
demanding
an
independence
referendum
.

The
bodies
of
six
people
were
found
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
region
Sunday
,
raising
the
death
toll
from
four
days
of
violence
to
25
,
local
hospital
officials
and
police
said
.

Two
were
soldiers
,
they
said
.

Most
of
the
civilian
victims
were
shot
by
security
forces
.

Indonesia
's
reformist-minded
President
Abdurrahman
Wahid
has
blamed
the
army
and
police
for
the
deaths
.

In
the
provincial
capital
Banda
Aceh
,
Indonesian
security
forces
opened
fire
at
two
cars
after
the
rally
Saturday
night
,
injuring
six
local
residents
.

Security
forces
patrolled
the
city
in
armored
vehicles
,
and
officers
carried
out
random
identification
checks
,
looking
for
separatist
leaders
.

Police
blocked
off
roads
and
prevented
thousands
from
returning
home
.

Intercity
buses
were
shut
down
.

Local
media
reports
estimated
that
up
to
100,000
people
rallied
Saturday
in
Banda
Aceh
,
demanding
a
U.N.-supervised
vote
for
independence
.

Witnesses
put
the
figure
at
about
30,000
.

The
rally
's
organizers
accused
security
forces
of
preventing
pro-independence
residents
from
reaching
the
capital
for
the
rally
,
which
last
year
attracted
an
estimated
250,000
people
.

Separatists
have
fought
since
1975
for
independence
in
Aceh
,
which
is
rich
in
oil
and
gas
and
has
a
population
of
about
4.1
million
people
.

At
least
5,500
people
have
been
killed
there
in
the
past
decade
.

The
government
plans
to
meet
with
the
rebel
group
,
the
Free
Aceh
Movement
,
in
Switzerland
this
week
to
try
to
stem
the
recent
escalation
in
bloodshed
.

Both
sides
signed
a
truce
in
Geneva
on
June
2
,
but
the
violence
has
continued
,
killing
at
least
227
people
since
then
.

Meanwhile
,
a
U.N.
Security
Council
fact-finding
team
arrived
Sunday
in
East
Timor
,
which
won
broke
from
Indonesia
last
year
.

The
mission
was
to
assess
the
security
situation
on
the
island
after
the
deaths
of
three
U.N.
aid
workers
in
Indonesian
West
Timor
in
September
.

CHICAGO
(
AP
)
_
Eric
Daze
's
goal
late
in
the
third
period
was
the
game-winner
as
the
Chicago
Blackhawks
beat
the
Anaheim
Mighty
Ducks
4-2
Sunday
night
.

The
Blackhawks
posted
consecutive
victories
for
the
first
time
this
season
.

Steve
Sullivan
,
who
had
two
assists
,
added
an
empty-net
goal
with
36
seconds
left
and
had
two
assists
.

Michael
Nylander
and
Tony
Amonte
also
scored
for
Chicago
,
which
has
won
three
of
its
last
four
games
.

Daze
's
goal
was
his
second
of
the
season
.

He
had
asked
the
Blackhawks
to
trade
him
a
week
ago
and
was
a
healthy
scratch
in
back-to-back
games
in
Minnesota
last
Sunday
and
Boston
Thursday
.

Teemu
Selanne
and
Marty
McInnis
scored
for
Anaheim
,
which
is
winless
in
its
last
four
game
(
0-2-2
)
.

Guy
Hebert
started
in
goal
for
Anaheim
,
but
was
replaced
after
just
15
seconds
by
Dominic
Roussel
,
who
faced
all
37
Chicago
shots
.

Blackhawks
starter
Jocelyn
Thibault
finished
with
15
saves
.

Nylander
opened
the
scoring
1:51
in
when
he
skated
,
unchecked
,
from
the
right
wing
boards
and
across
the
slot
.

Selanne
tied
it
at
1
with
4:11
left
in
the
first
.

After
circling
the
Chicago
net
,
he
lofted
a
backhander
over
Thibault
's
shoulder
.

McInnis
gave
Anaheim
a
2-1
lead
at
4:40
of
the
second
,
sliding
in
a
backhander
from
the
goal
line
during
a
pile
up
in
the
crease
.

Amonte
tie
it
just
over
two
minutes
later
when
he
one-timed
a
power-play
goal
from
10
feet
.

Daze
's
scored
the
game-winner
from
the
left
circle
at
5:43
of
the
third
after
intercepting
German
Titov
's
weak
clearing
attempt
.

Notes
:
Selanne
has
six
goals
and
six
assists
in
his
last
12
games
.

...
Chicago
's
line
of
Nylander
,
Sullivan
and
Dean
McAmmond
has
been
hot
.

Sullivan
,
has
four
goals
and
three
assists
in
his
last
four
games
.

Nylander
has
three
goals
and
two
assists
over
the
same
span
.

...
Sunday
night
's
crowd
was
announced
as
13,360
,
but
the
20,500-seat
United
Center
was
barely
half
full
.

Zhang
Yongqing
,

and
the

long-time
rival
party
chief
Li
Xianying
,
the
Legal

Zhang
hired

Zhengping
,
Zhang
Rongguo
and
Zhang
Baofu

the
party
secretary
for

sum
of
20,000

.

The

MOSCOW
,
Feb.

-

As
Secretary
of
State
Madeleine
K.
Albright
continued
her
mission
seeking
the
support
of
Persian
Gulf
states
for
possible
airstrikes
against
Iraq
,
Russia
,
France
and
Turkey
today
intensified
separate
diplomatic
initiatives
aimed
at
averting
military
action
.

Russian
officials
claimed
a
breakthrough
in
their
talks
with
Iraq
,
saying
Iraqi
President
Saddam
Hussein
had
given
qualified
permission
for
U.N.
representatives
to
visit
eight
presidential
sites
that
were
previously
off-limits
to
the
U.N.
weapons
inspection
teams
.

Iraq
,
however
,
dismissed
the
Russian
report
as
"
totally
,
totally
incorrect
.
"

Iraq
's
undersecretary
for
foreign
affairs
,
Riyadh
Qaysi
,
told
a
news
conference
that
"
no
such
thing
was
discussed
"
by
Saddam
Hussein
and
Russian
Deputy
Foreign
Minister
Viktor
Posuvalyuk
in
talks
in
Baghdad
tonight
.

Qaysi
added
:
"
Discussion
with
Mr.
Posuvalyuk
is
still
going
on
to
find
a
diplomatic
and
political
solution
to
the
crisis
.

I
am
not
going
to
provide
you
with
even
a
shade
. . .
of
what
is
being
discussed
.

Discussions
are
going
on
,
and
this
is
a
good
thing
.
"

Officials
at
the
Kremlin
and
Russian
Foreign
Ministry
,
who
earlier
were
hailing
the
offer
as
a
triumph
for
Russian
diplomacy
,
stopped
answering
telephone
calls
after
word
of
Iraq
's
denial
of
a
deal
reached
Moscow
.

Senior
Clinton
administration
officials
reacted
coldly
to
the
Russian
plan
.
"

I
do
n't
think
it
's
an
appropriate
solution
at
this
time
,
"
Secretary
of
Defense
William
S.
Cohen
said
at
the
Pentagon
.

Asked
about
the
Russian
proposal
following
her
talks
with
Saudi
Crown
Prince
Abdullah
in
Riyadh
,
Albright
said
:
"
Having
kind
of
piecemeal
inspections
,
that
does
not
strike
me
as
meeting
the
basic
standards
that
we
have
been
talking
about
for
so
long
.
"

President
Clinton
and
Russian
President
Boris
Yeltsin
discussed
Iraq
during
a
20-minute
phone
conversation
today
.

A
White
House
official
said
Clinton
stressed
to
Yeltsin
"
the
need
for
unity
"
among
U.N.
Security
Council
members
in
seeking
to
force
Iraq
to
accept
full
access
by
U.N.
weapons
inspection
teams
.

"
The
president
agreed
with
Yeltsin
on
the
desirability
of
a
diplomatic
solution
"
to
the
standoff
,
the
official
said
.
"

But
Clinton
said
that
Saddam
Hussein
's
continued
defiance
of
the
inspection
teams
is
unacceptable
.
"

A
French
envoy
reportedly
was
to
set
out
for
Baghdad
from
the
Jordanian
capital
,
Amman
,
on
Tuesday
.

French
President
Jacques
Chirac
dispatched
top
Foreign
Ministry
official
Bertrand
Dufourcq
to
Iraq
as
part
of
an
apparent
French
gambit
to
reach
a
diplomatic
settlement
.

A
French
presidential
spokeswoman
said
Dufourcq
was
carrying
a
"
very
firm
"
message
to
Saddam
Hussein
that
he
must
begin
cooperating
with
the
United
Nations
,
the
Reuters
news
agency
reported
.

She
said
Chirac
and
Yeltsin
discussed
the
Iraqi
crisis
during
a
30-minute
phone
conversation
Monday
night
.

"
France
and
Russia
continue
to
favor
a
diplomatic
solution
to
resolve
the
crisis
and
obtain
Iraq
's
full
respect
for
Security
Council
resolutions
,
"
said
the
spokeswoman
,
who
was
not
identified
.
"

The
French
and
the
Russians
are
continuing
their
cooperation
with
other
Security
Council
members
to
assure
unanimity
in
the
firmness
of
their
approach
to
Iraq
.
"

Marc
Grossman
,
U.S.
assistant
secretary
of
state
for
European
and
Canadian
affairs
,
who
was
in
Ankara
today
for
talks
with
Turkish
government
and
military
leaders
,
voiced
doubt
that
any
of
the
diplomatic
initiatives
could
successfully
end
the
crisis
.
"

Whether
they
be
Turkish
,
French
or
Russian
,
if
[
the
diplomatic
initiatives
]
can
produce
a
result
,
well
,
we
would
welcome
that
,
"
he
said
.
"

But
I
must
say
that
we
are
skeptical
,
given
the
past
Iraqi
behavior
.
"

Nonetheless
,
Turkish
Foreign
Minister
Ismail
Cem
announced
he
will
travel
to
Iraq
later
this
week
.
"

We
do
n't
want
our
children
to
be
threatened
by
weapons
of
mass
destruction
,
"
he
told
reporters
.
"

But
we
do
n't
want
a
war
either
.
"

U.S.
Air
Force
Gen.
Joseph
Ralston
,
vice
chairman
of
the
Joint
Chiefs
of
Staff
and
a
member
of
the
visiting
U.S.
delegation
in
Ankara
,
said
the
United
States
has
not
formally
asked
Turkey
for
use
of
its
southern
Incirlik
air
base
for
a
possible
bombing
campaign
against
Iraq
.
"

No
decisions
have
been
made
on
the
use
of
force
,
"
Ralston
told
reporters
,
"
and
as
a
result
,
we
have
made
no
new
requests
to
the
Turkish
military
.
"

But
Turkish
Defense
Minister
Ismet
Sezgin
held
open
the
possibility
that
Turkey
would
give
its
permission
.
"

We
have
not
received
any
such
request
up
until
now
.

If
a
request
came
then
we
would
evaluate
it
,
"
he
said
at
a
news
conference
.

Egyptian
state
television
reported
that
Iraqi
Foreign
Minister
Mohammed
Saeed
Sahhaf
will
visit
Cairo
in
the
next
two
days
for
talks
.

Egyptian
President
Hosni
Mubarak
,
who
is
to
meet
with
Albright
in
Cairo
on
Tuesday
,
discussed
the
crisis
with
13
Arab
leaders
,
the
TV
report
said
.

Faced
with
rising
tensions
in
the
Persian
Gulf
,
Israel
today
deployed
four
batteries
of
U.S.
Patriot
missiles
on
a
hill
in
its
southern
Negev
desert
.

The
missiles
were
installed
above
the
city
of
Arad
,
about
27
miles
from
an
Israeli
nuclear
reactor
that
was
the
apparent
target
of
some
of
the
39
Scud
missiles
that
Iraq
fired
at
the
Jewish
state
in
the
1991
Gulf
War
.

The
Israeli
army
,
which
first
refused
to
comment
on
the
deployment
,
later
called
it
a
routine
training
drill
.

Russia
repeatedly
has
opposed
threats
made
by
the
United
States
and
backed
by
Britain
to
bomb
Iraq
if
Saddam
Hussein
does
not
grant
U.N.
inspectors
unhindered
access
to
sites
they
suspect
are
used
for
storage
and
development
of
nuclear
,
chemical
or
biological
weapons
or
missiles
capable
of
delivering
them
.

"
An
evident
shift
in
Iraq
's
position
was
achieved
due
to
Russian
diplomacy
,
"
said
Sergei
Yastrzhembsky
,
Yeltsin
's
spokesman
,
before
Iraq
issued
its
denial
.
"

Diplomatic
efforts
to
settle
the
situation
have
not
been
exhausted
.
"

According
to
Tass
and
the
Interfax
news
agency
,
Saddam
had
agreed
to
permit
inspectors
access
to
the
eight
sites
,
all
of
which
are
presidential
compounds
,
so
long
as
the
team
included
technicians
from
of
each
of
the
five
permanent
member
states
of
the
U.N.
Security
Council
--
the
United
States
,
Russia
,
China
,
Britain
and
France
.

The
inspections
would
also
have
to
take
place
in
the
company
of
diplomats
from
each
of
the
five
.

In
effect
,
the
plan
would
suggest
that
the
inspectors
represent
not
the
United
Nations
,
but
their
countries
of
origin
.

The
Iraqi
leader
put
a
further
condition
on
the
visits
:
Although
the
inspectors
would
be
permitted
to
visit
the
buildings
,
they
could
not
inspect
the
territory
surrounding
them
,
according
to
an
account
issued
by
Interfax
.

That
would
fall
short
of
the
U.S.
and
British
insistence
that
the
inspectors
have
unlimited
access
.

BEIJING
,
Feb.
11
-

Vice
Premier
Zhu
Rongji
is
pushing
a
controversial
plan
to
streamline
China
's
bloated
government
bureaucracy
that
would
take
effect
just
after
next
month
's
session
of
the
National
People
's
Congress
.

Zhu
wants
to
merge
several
ministries
whose
duties
overlap
.

Sources
suggest
10
or
more
ministries
could
be
merged
with
others
or
abolished
.

In
addition
,
Zhu
is
planning
to
take
ministries
overseeing
industries
and
convert
them
into
state-owned
companies
that
would
be
expected
to
run
on
a
more
efficient
,
economically
viable
basis
.

"
At
present
,
governmental
agencies
manage
a
lot
of
things
they
should
n't
manage
and
ca
n't
manage
well
,
"
said
Zhang
Xiuxue
,
vice
president
of
the
Chinese
National
School
of
Administration
.
"

The
expansion
of
government
agencies
has
hindered
economic
development
.
"

But
Zhang
said
the
proposed
government
overhaul
"
is
still
very
difficult
.

Some
people
do
n't
want
to
give
up
the
authority
they
already
have
.
"

"
Few
people
oppose
Zhu
's
idea
for
streamlining
government
,
"
said
a
government
official
,
"
except
when
it
comes
to
their
own
ministry
or
department
.
"

Despite
widespread
opposition
to
the
plan
from
people
who
would
lose
status
,
authority
or
even
their
jobs
,
most
analysts
said
Zhu
will
,
for
the
most
part
,
get
his
way
.

The
powerful
vice
premier
,
who
has
been
the
government
's
chief
economic
policymaker
,
is
widely
expected
to
become
China
's
new
premier
during
the
Party
Congress
next
month
.

With
the
rest
of
Asia
in
the
throes
of
economic
crisis
,
few
Chinese
leaders
would
want
to
undermine
the
authority
of
the
person
who
is
considered
most
responsible
for
helping
China
avoid
the
fate
of
its
neighbors
.

In
what
appeared
to
be
an
effort
to
divert
some
flak
away
from
Zhu
,
Hu
Jintao
,
another
member
of
the
Communist
Party
's
all-powerful
seven-man
Standing
Committee
,
is
leading
the
working
committee
nominally
in
charge
of
devising
the
streamlining
plan
.

In
the
past
,
many
government
departments
were
created
to
serve
as
power
bases
for
political
groups
within
the
ruling
Communist
Party
and
as
rewards
for
long-serving
party
cadres
.

There
are
40
ministries
under
the
State
Council
,
China
's
cabinet
,
plus
eight
institutions
,
13
administrations
and
bureaus
,
and
seven
offices
.

Now
,
Zhu
is
proposing
to
merge
bodies
that
duplicate
each
other
's
work
.

For
example
,
the
State
Commission
for
Economic
Restructuring
might
merge
with
the
State
Council
's
Development
Research
Center
.

The
Ministry
of
Labor
and
the
Ministry
of
Personnel
could
combine
.

The
Ministry
of
Communications
could
join
the
Ministry
of
Posts
and
Telecommunications
.

The
Ministry
of
Culture
and
Ministry
of
Radio
,
Film
and
Television
also
have
been
tapped
for
possible
consolidation
.

The
ministries
dealing
with
particular
industries
are
likely
to
become
state-owned
corporations
.

At
the
top
of
that
list
is
the
Ministry
of
the
Chemical
Industry
,
sources
said
.

Other
possibilities
are
the
ministries
for
railways
,
the
electronics
industry
,
machine-building
plants
and
coal
mining
.

Most
of
these
ministries
are
swollen
with
unneeded
employees
.

Conversion
to
state-owned
corporations
is
no
guarantee
of
improved
performance
,
however
.

The
petroleum
ministry
was
converted
to
the
Chinese
National
Petroleum
Corp.
several
years
ago
,
but
it
still
is
struggling
to
trim
its
staff
and
improve
efficiency
.

The
corporation
employs
a
staggering
1.51
million
people
in
a
wide
range
of
tasks
,
from
running
universities
to
building
roads
,
from
drilling
wells
to
making
watches
,
from
maintaining
pipelines
to
operating
hospitals
.

On
Sunday
,
the
corporation
said
it
would
launch
a
new
set
of
reforms
,
including
laying
off
250,000
workers
.

It
said
it
also
would
seek
to
delegate
managerial
responsibility
to
subsidiaries
and
list
certain
parts
of
its
business
on
domestic
and
international
markets
.

The
airline
and
railway
industries
also
have
announced
massive
layoffs
.

The
current
drive
to
streamline
government
is
not
the
first
time
Zhu
has
taken
on
entrenched
interests
within
China
's
system
of
governing
,
but
in
the
past
they
were
mostly
at
the
provincial
level
.

As
vice
premier
and
president
of
the
People
's
Bank
of
China
in
1995
,
Zhu
clamped
down
on
the
free
flow
of
credit
from
provincial
branches
of
the
bank
to
projects
and
state-owned
enterprises
favored
by
provincial
officials
.

He
also
overhauled
tax
revenue
sharing
to
stop
the
slide
in
the
central
government
's
share
of
national
tax
revenues
.

BAGHDAD
,
Iraq
(
AP
)
_
Iraq
's
deputy
foreign
minister
attacked
U.S.
National
Security
Advisor
Sandy
Berger
Friday
,
accusing
him
of
``
lies
and
deception
.
''

Riyadh
al-Qaysi
picked
his
way
through
Berger
's
press
conference
in
Washington
hours
earlier
,
criticizing
the
security
advisor
's
assertion
that
Iraq
had
been
repeatedly
in
``
material
breach
''
of
U.N.
Security
Council
resolutions
.

``
Iraq
challenges
(
Berger
)
to
produce
one
Security
Council
resolution
using
those
two
words
,
''
al-Qaysi
told
reporters
in
Baghdad
.

He
said
that
Berger
might
not
have
been
concerned
with
reality
,
because
he
had
indicated
that
if
the
United
States
did
not
have
the
Security
Council
's
unanimous
support
for
a
military
strike
,
it
would
go
ahead
anyway
.

``
Everybody
knows
that
under
the
charter
of
the
United
Nations
,
the
five
permanent
members
have
a
special
responsibility
for
the
maintenance
of
international
peace
and
security
and
there
are
three
permanent
members
_
namely
Russia
,
France
and
China
_
who
do
not
want
war
,
so
unanimity
does
not
exist
,
''
al-Qaysi
said
.

The
deputy
foreign
minister
accused
Berger
of
being
part
of
a
campaign
against
Iraq
.

``
This
campaign
is
being
conducted
on
the
basis
of
lies
and
deception
and
should
not
be
taken
by
anyone
in
the
world
as
being
a
justifiable
basis
for
war
.
''

``
This
is
exactly
what
the
United
States
,
as
supported
by
the
United
Kingdom
,
are
trying
to
achieve
.

Walter

and
``
Help

,
''
died
on
Oct.
17
in
Woodland
Hills
,
Calif.
He
was
81
.

Shenson
,
who
was
born
in
San
Francisco
,
was
working
in
London
as
a
film
producer
_
most
notably
of
``
The
Mouse
That
Roared
,
''
with
Peter
Sellers
_
when
he
was
approached
by
United
Artists
to
oversee
the
first
foray
into
cinema
by
the
Beatles
.

The
studio
had
discovered
that
the
recording
contract
between
the
Beatles
and
EMI
did
not
cover
film
soundtracks
.

Although
the
Beatles
had
yet
to
tour
the
United
States
,
the
group
's
popularity
in
Britain
was
phenomenal
,
and
United
Artists
decided
to
exploit
it
by
putting
out
a
cheaply
made
film
as
a
pretext
for
a
soundtrack
album
.

He
hired
Richard
Lester
,
a
fellow
American
,
to
direct
.

At
the
suggestion
of
Paul
McCartney
,
he
recruited
the
Liverpool
-
based
playwright
Alun
Owen
to
write
the
screenplay
.

The
film
's
prospects
were
so
little
regarded
that
while
Shenson
was
prepared
to
offer
the
Beatles
25
percent
of
the
net
income
,
the
band
's
manager
,
Brian
Epstein
,
initially
asked
for
only
7
percent
.

United
Artists
thought
that
the
Beatles
would
be
a
short-lived
phenomenon
,
but
Shenson
foresaw
their
staying
power
and
struck
an
agreement
with
the
studio
that
all
rights
to
the
film
would
revert
to
him
after
15
years
.

``
A
Hard
Day
's
Night
''
was
so
popular
that
Shenson
said
the
studio
recouped
what
it
spent
on
the
production
_
about
$
600,000
_
in
just
one
day
after
the
film
's
release
in
1964
.

A
reissue
of
the
film
is
to
appear
in
theaters
later
this
year
.

Shenson
was
on
the
set
every
day
,
and
after
he
had
looked
at
some
early
rushes
his
wife
asked
him
whether
the
Beatles
could
act
.

``
I
do
n't
know
if
they
can
act
,
''
he
replied
,
``
but
you
ca
n't
keep
your
eyes
off
them

His
wife
,
Geraldine

died
last

He
is
survived
by
two
sons

Richard

BERLIN
(

_
U.S.
businessman
Edmond
Pope
was
discharged
Saturday
from
a
U.S.
military
hospital
where
he
had
been
undergoing
tests
since
his
release
after
months
in
a
Russian
prison
on
espionage
charges
,
a
hospital
spokeswoman
said
.

Pope
,
the
first
American
convicted
of
espionage
in
Russia
in
40
years
,
will
be
heading
home
Sunday
or
Monday
.

He
was
pardoned
Thursday
by
Russian
President
Vladimir
Putin
and
immediately
flew
to
Ramstein
Air
Base
in
Germany
.

``
If
he
is
discharged
,
he
is
in
good
condition
,
''
said
Marie
Shaw
,
a
spokeswoman
at
the
hospital
in
Landstuhl
,
near
Frankfurt
.

Pope
,
54
,
has
suffered
in
the
past
from
a
rare
form
of
bone
cancer
,
and
doctors
said
Friday
it
was
unclear
if
it
had
resurfaced
.

They
also
ran
tests
for
three
lesions
that
were
possible
skin
cancer
.

Shaw
said
she
did
not
know
the
results
of
those
tests
and
could
not
release
any
information
without
Pope
's
consent
.

Pope
,
who
was
held
for
253
days
before
his
release
,
was
to
leave
for
the
United
States
on
a
regular
flight
,
Shaw
said
.

His
first
destination
will
be
Oregon
,
where
his
mother
is
caring
for
his
ailing
father
,
Shaw
said
.

``
He
's
very
concerned
about
his
father
,
''
she
said
.

The
Popes
intend
to
be
back
in
their
hometown
of
State
College
,
Penn.
for
Christmas
.

Until
his
departure
,
Pope
is
staying
with
his
wife
,
Cheri
,
in
a
hotel
located
on
Ramstein
Air
Base
,
which
he
is
entitled
to
use
because
he
is
a
retired
U.S.
Navy
officer
.

``
He
's
happy
and
eating
well
,
relaxing
with
his
wife
,
''
Shaw
said
.

Pope
was
sentenced
to
20
years
in
jail
by
a
Moscow
court
on
Dec.
6
.

He
has
denied
the
charges
that
he
obtained
secret
torpedo
technology
,
saying
the
information
has
been
published
.

He
was
in
a
business
meeting
in
Moscow
for
his
company
,
CERF
Technologies
International
,
last
April
when
a
dozen
security
agents
stormed
in
and
arrested
him
and
the
Russians
who
were
in
the
room
.

Pope
said
Friday
he
had
not
been
mistreated
while
in
Moscow
's
high-security
Lefortovo
prison
,
but
the
lack
of
vitamins
from
his
bland
diet
of
porridge
,
potatoes
,
fish
and
soup
took
a
toll
on
his
health
.

``
There
was
no
physical
abuse
,
''
he
said
.

``
They
were
extremely
careful
with
me
.

It
was
clear
to
my
after
a
while
that
I
was
there
for
political
reasons

BEIJING
(
AP
)
_
Japan
and
North
Korea
on
Monday
opened
their
third
round
of
talks
this
year
on
normalizing
relations
,
as
Tokyo
tries
not
to
fall
behind
U.S.
and
South
Korean
efforts
to
improve
ties
with
the
isolated
communist
nation
.

Japanese
chief
negotiator
Kojiro
Takano
welcomed
his
North
Korean
counterpart
,
Jong
Thae
Hwa
,
at
Japan
's
embassy
on
neutral
territory
in
Beijing
for
the
first
of
two
days
of
talks
aimed
at
laying
the
groundwork
for
a
future
agreement
.

Japan
,
which
ruled
the
Korean
Peninsula
as
a
colony
from
1910
to
the
end
of
World
War
II
in
1945
,
has
never
had
normal
diplomatic
ties
with
North
Korea
,
and
intensely
emotional
issues
still
divide
the
two
.

The
two
previous
rounds
of
talks
have
sputtered
over
North
Korea
's
insistence
on
compensation
for
Japan
's
often
brutal
occupation
and
Tokyo
's
demands
for
information
on
Japanese
citizens
allegedly
abducted
to
North
Korea
to
train
spies
.

Still
,
there
's
a
sense
of
urgency
in
Tokyo
,
with
the
talks
coming
on
the
heels
of
historic
visits
to
Pyongyang
by
U.S.
Secretary
of
State
Madeleine
Albright
and
South
Korea
's
President
Kim
Dae-jung
.

Germany
,
Britain
and
Spain
have
also
made
moves
to
normalize
ties
with
the
North
.

Some
in
Japan
fear
North
Korean
leader
Kim
Jong
Il
's
recent
success
in
reaching
out
to
other
nations
may
even
encourage
him
to
take
a
harder
line
with
Tokyo
.

North
Korea
broke
off
earlier
talks
on
ties
eight
years
ago
after
angrily
rejecting
Tokyo
's
demands
to
track
down
10
Japanese
citizens
allegedly
abducted
by
Northern
agents
.

Although
talks
finally
resumed
in
April
,
Tokyo
and
Pyongyang
still
do
n't
see
eye
to
eye
over
the
abduction
issue
.

North
Korea
has
denied
abducting
anyone
.

A
public
outcry
was
raised
in
Japan
over
press
reports
Prime
Minister
Yoshiro
Mori
may
have
backed
a
face-saving
compromise
raised
three
years
ago
.

The
deal
would
have
allowed
any
Japanese
in
the
North
to
return
via
a
third
country
without
Pyongyang
having
to
admit
wrongdoing
.

A
compromise
may
also
be
in
the
offing
over
Japanese
colonization
of
the
Korean
Peninsula
.

The
North
Korean
delegation
is
expected
to
press
Japan
for
an
official
apology
and
compensation
for
the
occupation
.

Although
Japan
has
rejected
the
demands
,
it
has
expressed
willingness
to
extend
economic
aid
,
as
it
did
upon
normalizing
relations
with
South
Korea
in
1965
.

Since
the
last
round
of
talks
in
August
,
Japan
has
said
it
will
send
half
a
million
tons
of
rice
over
the
next
two
years
to
help
ease
acute
food
shortages
in
the
North
.

Japan
's
media
have
speculated
that
offers
of
hefty
aid
packages
may
tempt
Pyongyang
into
overcoming
any
reluctance
about
signing
a
normalization
agreement
.

Japanese
negotiators
are
also
likely
to
address
North
Korea
's
missile
program
,
which
sent
a
three-stage
missile
sailing
over
northern
Japan
two
years
ago
.

LOS
ANGELES
,
May
2
(
AFP
)

Beleaguered
French
media
group
Vivendi
Universal
is
in
advanced
negotiations
to
sell
its
theme
park
business
to
a
US
firm
for
around
1.5
billion
dollars
,
the
Los
Angeles
Times
said
Friday
.

The
report
came
as
the
indebted
group
said
it
was
planning
to
sell
off
its
US
unit
Vivendi
Universal
Entertainment
and
other
assets
,
to
focus
on
its
telecoms
activities
and
its
French
cable
television
business
.

The
Times
said
Vivendi
Universal
was
negotiating
to
sell
its
flagship
theme
parks
to
New
York
investment
firm
Blackstone
Group
as
a
the
first
step
toward
dismantling
its
entertainment
empire
.

Vivendi
Universal
officials
in
the
United
States
were
not
immediately
available
for
comment
on
Friday
.

Under
the
reported
plans
,
Blackstone
Group
would
buy
Vivendi
's
theme
park
division
,
including
Universal
Studios
Hollywood
,
Universal
Orlando
in
Florida
and
Universal
's
ownership
interests
in
parks
in
Spain
and
Japan
,
a
source
close
to
the
negotiations
told
the
paper
.

Blackstone
already
holds
a
50
percent
stake
in
the
two
parks
that
make
up
Universal
Orlando
.

Vivendi
earlier
this
week
confirmed
months
of
press
speculation
that
it
planned
to
shed
its
entertainment
assets
by
the
end
of
the
year
,
including
its
famed
Universal
movie
studio
and
television
assets
.

Chief
executive
Jean-Rene
Fourtou
told
shareholders
at
the
group
's
annual
general
meeting
Tuesday
that
the
sale
of
Vivendi
Universal
Entertainment
was
a
major
goal
for
2003
,
and
that
negotiations
were
already
under
way
.

However
,
Fourtou
said
he
had
not
yet
received
any
firm
offer
for
its
giant
US
music
business
,
Universal
Music
Group
,
and
had
taken
no
final
decision
over
its
future
.

The
group
,
once
a
French
utilities
company
,
needs
to
reshape
itself
in
order
to
slash
its
huge
debt
burden
of
around
18
billion
dollars
.

In
2002
,
the
group
recorded
a
net
loss
of
23.3
billion
euros
--
the
biggest
ever
in
France
--
on
sales
of
28.7
billion
.
